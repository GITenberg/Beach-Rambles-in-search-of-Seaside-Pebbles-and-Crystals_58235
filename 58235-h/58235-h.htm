<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>There is a pleasure to an intelligent mind in discovering
the origin, or tracing the past history, of any natural
object as revealed in its structure and growth. It is thus
that the study of trees and plants, ferns and field flowers,
occupies and delights us. And a similar interest would
be found to attach to Seaside Pebbles, as one branch of
mineralogy, if we could once come to observe and understand
them.</p>

<p>But while the marine shells of England have been all
numbered and classified, and even the seaweeds are
emerging out of dim confusion into the order of botanical
arrangement, there is no popular work extant on the
subject of our pebbles.</p>

<p>Dr. Mantell, indeed, published an elegant little volume,
entitled “Thoughts on a Pebble;” but he therein treats
of a single species, the <em>Choanite</em>; whereas, we have other
fossil creatures beside Choanites preserved in the heart
of siliceous pebbles; and our shores yield from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
time varieties of agate and jasper, differing from the
oriental, and some of them of great beauty.</p>

<p>In the present treatise, an attempt has been made to
commend this subject to more general attention, by
grouping together many scattered facts and methodizing
the results. Learned disquisitions and technical terms
have been as much as possible avoided; but in the concluding
chapters, sundry interesting points in natural
philosophy bearing upon the subject are handled rather
more scientifically; and here, some original matter will
be found.</p>

<p>The coloured plates are after drawings by a well-known
and ingenious artist;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the original specimens being in my
own collection. They have been carefully and faithfully
executed, and are on the same scale as the pebbles themselves.</p>

<p>If this essay of mine should induce any one possessed
of ampler leisure and more adequate powers to enter
more largely upon the merits of the theme, I shall be
indeed gratified.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>ASPECT OF A BEACH, AND ITS PROBABLE ORIGIN.—TRUE
NATURE OF THE PEBBLES WHICH COMPOSE IT.</p>

</div>

<p>I know of few things more pleasant than to ramble for a
mile along one of our southern beaches in the early days
of autumn. We get the sniff of the sea-breeze; we see
prismatic colours dappling the water, or curiously reflected
from capes of wet sand; solemn, beetling cliffs, broken
here and there by a green slope, rise on one side of us;
while, on the other, we are enchanted by the wild music
of the waves, as they dash noisily upon the shingle at
our feet, and then trickle back with faint, lisping murmurs
into the azure gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Alpine scenery is majestic, and river-lit landscapes are
delicious; but they seem as pictures of still life compared
with the stir and resonance of the shore and the ocean.
The breeze which bends the standing corn does not impart
so much pleasure as that which dimples the bay at
the foot of our rustic garden; the thunder-cloud resting
on a mountain is not so impressive as that huge wall of
inky blackness, which seems as if it would choke the
very light and air while it gathers on the horizon, but
will presently rend asunder and purify the overcharged
atmosphere by launching a tempest upon the face of the
deep.</p>

<p>There are few persons who, after spending one or two
consecutive summers at Eastbourne, or in the Isle of
Wight, can repress an ardent longing to visit similar
scenes from time to time.</p>

<p>The sea-side stroll has, however, been accused of monotony.
But this is either by really incompetent judges,
or by inveterate sportsmen, to whom the neighbourhood
of the ocean suggests nothing more apposite than a meet
with harriers on the downs, or a raid upon puzzled rabbits
in some outlying warren, with the aid of a keeper,
ferrets, and “varmint” dogs. To such, even a brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
sojourn on the simple-featured coast may, undoubtedly,
prove wearisome; but the fault rests with themselves.
For, all the while, others, who are better informed and
more awake to what lies around them, will be cheerfully
occupied in kindred pursuits at the foot of the cliff, or
away on the beach, or far out, at low tide, among the
weedy rocks and sand. Here they hunt the cockle and
the razor-shell, collect bright algæ and marvellous zoophytes,
or search for agates and fossils among the endless
heaps of shingle.</p>

<p>The delicate actiniæ and the rarer sea-weeds cannot be
obtained in winter; but the pebbles, which are intended
to form the subject of this little book, may always be
met with; and the changes induced by rough winds and
surging tides, yield them in even greater abundance.</p>

<p>The pleasure of collecting pebbles has been greatly
enhanced, to my mind, by considering how it is that we
come to have pebbly beaches at all. Inevitable as these
may appear to some people, they are quite a phenomenon
in their way, and to the full as deserving our attention as
the colony in a rabbit-warren.</p>

<p>Originally, the land alone possesses such materials; but
it is the sea which finds them out; and these two facts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
put side by side, have sometimes reminded me of the
arbitrary allotment of the sexes in the old mythology.
<i lang="la">Oceanus</i> being an enterprising gentleman. <i lang="la">Terra</i> (always
feminine) is the quiescent lady, to whom he pays his
court. She carries a prodigious number of these treasures
in her flinty bosom; but it is only he, and his
friends the rivers, who can get at them and draw them
forth. In our English Channel, Ocean is as fond of
doing this, and of fringing his waterline with a brown
pebbly border, as other gentlemen are, now-a-days, of
wearing, if possible, a beard like that of the Sophi. Nor
is this surprising, when we remember that all creatures
naturally desire something which they have not got. For
the bottom of the sea itself is no beach at all, but chalk
or sand, and sometimes hardened sandstone, with, I dare
say, many precipitous pits and hollows, and many pointed
crags. Here, gigantic fronds of the oar-weed wave to
and fro among thousands of acres of dulse and bladderwrack;
while porpoises and dog-fish dive, and limpets
and mussels crawl, and arrowy lobsters shoot through
the cerulean gloom, and (if Mr. Tennyson may be believed)
mermen and mermaids play at hide-and-seek.
Wonderful things there must be, if we could only spy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
them out; but I do not think many pebbles. Whereas,
our mother Earth teems with these latter. There are jaspers
in the conglomerate, and agates in the mountain
rocks, and veins of porphyry and serpentine in the trap
and basalt, and garnets and sapphires in the granite, and
flint-nodules in the chalk, and quartz-crystals almost
everywhere. Probably these exist, also, in many of the
submarine strata; but unless a volcanic eruption should
occur, there is no force in operation there to dislodge
them. The bed of the ocean, and all depths of it below
a hundred feet perpendicular,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as <em>divers</em> well know, remain
calm and still, even when a tempest is raging above.
But on what we are pleased to call “terra firma,” the
case is reversed. Solid as the ground appears, all is subject
to elemental change and motion; and whenever the
waves of the sea or the strong current of a river can
plough some crumbling chine, or wear away the face of a
cliff, down come the imbedded pebbles and crystals, and
gradually form a <em>beach</em> upon the margin of the ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
And this beach is tossed up and down, and rolled to and
fro, until most of the stones composing it have become
as smooth as hazel-nuts.</p>

<p>The above may be rather a rough sketch of the source
of a beach; but I believe it is correct in its leading features.
In a subsequent chapter we may better note certain
peculiarities which are more than meet the eye.</p>

<p>But what are the pebbles themselves?</p>

<p>Most persons have occasionally handled specimens of
the precious stones or “gems;” but few of them, perhaps,
are aware that our pebbles of the road-side and
sea-shore claim a common origin with these dazzling
crystals. Such is, however, the fact. Chemical analysis,
availing itself of the blow-pipe, the solvent acids, and
the voltaic battery, has succeeded in determining the
base of every known gem. And the earths which furnish
such bases are chiefly two—ALUMINA, or clay, and
SILICA, or pure flint. From these, with an admixture
of lime, and sometimes of iron, in small quantities, all
the native gems are derived, with the exception of the
diamond, whose base is CARBON.</p>

<p>Intensely hard as these substances are, and apparently
not susceptible of change if left to themselves, they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
probably passed through great chemical changes in the
silent laboratory of Nature. For it is supposed that our
operations in analysis, if carefully conducted, merely
bring back their subjects, by a kind of <em>reversing</em> process,
to their several primitive bases.</p>

<p>Now it is evident that the commoner pebbles are derived
from these same earths, of clay or flint, albeit in
a debased condition. For there is nothing else of which
they could be made: neither do they exhibit any properties
foreign to those which such substances possess.
Yet, how vast is the difference between an oriental gem
and the brightest production of clay-pits or granite rocks.
Not greater, however, than that between Damascus steel
and coarse pig-iron; or, between French lawn and sail-cloth.
And if Art can work such distinctions, why not
Nature?</p>

<p>In fact, a perfect gem is a master-piece which chemistry
and crystallization have combined to elaborate, and which
man has ransacked the corners of the earth to obtain. The
deep has been made to surrender its treasures to the diver
or the sunken net: the rock has been blasted, and its inmost
vein searched: the rushing river filtered, and its sand
sifted: and the contents of the jeweller’s caskets are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
result. Here may be seen diamonds from Golconda;
and rubies from Samarcand and Pegu: sapphires, emeralds,
and amethysts from Persia, Arabia, and Armenia:
the topaz, blazing like fire, from the Indies or from the
Ural: the turquoise, with its delicious blue, from Arabia
and Palestine: the opal from Honduras: the blood-red
garnet and amandine from Bohemia, Ceylon, and Greenland:
the jacinth and the chrysoprase, the chrysolite
and beryl, with pure pearls of globular form, all from the
land of the rising sun, while a deep brown jasper, rayed
with stripes and rings as black as jet, has travelled like a
wandering palmer from sultry Egypt or the terrible desert
of Sinai.</p>

<p>To form and perfect the finer crystals, extremes of
heat or cold appear to be necessary: whereas our clime
has perhaps always been temperate. Beside this, it is
probable that the mother-earth is not found pure with us.
There is a kind of white clay, called “kaolin,” obtained in
one particular quarry near Meissen in Saxony, and met
with nowhere else. From this clay the exquisite Dresden
porcelain is baked, and this clay cannot be exactly imitated.
A near approach to it has been made by mixing
good potter’s clay with pounded chalcedony-flints; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
still the <em>biscuit</em> so produced is never equal to that from
the “kaolin.” In like manner, we may suppose that the
peculiar earth which exists in sapphires no longer occurs
in our post-tertiary clay-beds.</p>

<p>Moreover, we know that there are many different clays
occurring in our geological strata. We have the clays
of the Lower Tertiary; the clay of the Wealden; and the
Kimmeridge and Oxford clays, both of which belong to
the Oolite. Also in these main divisions, sundry mineralogical
varieties are comprised under a common name.
But the great age of the granite formation renders it certain
that from none of these clays could those sapphires
have come (as to their <em>base</em>), which are born of
the granite rock. Indeed, our existing beds of clay are
more or less mingled with felspar, and felspar is one of
the “silicates;” whereas the blue sapphire is pure alumina
free from all admixture of silica.</p>

<p>However this may be, the great fields for gems are
in India and the island of Ceylon, and in certain parts
of the Russian dominions. No very valuable stones have
as yet been obtained from Australia; although the vicinity
of gold-mines has always been held to be prolific
in at least one kind: the “mother of ruby” being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
roseate substance embedded in the rock, and generally
met with alongside of a vein of gold. The topazes are
not equal to those from Saxony.</p>

<p>As to our own sea-girt Isle, it is surely as guiltless
of indigenous gems, as of white elephants or birds of
paradise. Had any such existed with us, they must long
ere this have been brought to light and appeared in the
market. We have bored the plain to two hundred
fathoms’ depth: we have pierced the hillside in tunnels
which extend for miles: geologists and antiquarians have
delved and hammered and sifted: many curious fossils
have turned up, and a world’s wealth in minerals, but
never anything like a diamond or an oriental sapphire.</p>

<p>It is well that, to console us under such apparent
poverty as to the gems, we possess the treasure an hundred-fold
in other shapes, though derived from the same
sources. Clay gives us no sapphires; but it floors
our ponds and canals, furnishes our earthenware, and
yields the bricks which have built the ribs of London.
Carbon refuses to flash upon us in the rays of an indigenous
“brilliant,” but it feeds our furnaces, propels
our steamers and locomotives, and cheers a million of
household hearths under the well-known form of Coal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
And Iron is our national sceptre: it reddens here no
jacinth or ruby; but it supplies us with spades and
ploughshares, lays down thousands of miles of railway,
and has made England the forge and workshop of the
known world for giant engines and massive machinery.</p>

<p>If our wealth be less dazzling than that from Golconda
or Peru, it is, we may hope, more durable; flowing to us
through a healthier channel, by the honest labour and
steady perseverance of the sons of the soil.</p>

<p class="tb">This is somewhat of a digression from the subject of
Sea-side pebbles. But then, as was said, the magnificent
crystals are their near kindred; and in society the custom
is to bring in any great connections we may have, on the
first fair opportunity: that once done, our <em>respectability</em>
is supposed to be established.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>THE LAPIDARY’S BOARD; AND HIS WORKSHOP.</p>

</div>

<p>In some of our provincial towns along the coast, the
open door and cheerful bow-window of the lapidary,
generally situated in the best street, form a <i lang="fr">coup d’œil</i>
which can hardly fail of enticing a visitor to look in
once during his morning walk.</p>

<p>If he should do this, he will probably become aware,
by a certain whirring sound, that there is an inner room
which serves for a workshop. This latter I have always
been partial to: but as the contents of the show-room
are the most attractive, I will speak of them first, reserving
to the end of the chapter a description of the
lapidary’s wheel and other implements of his trade.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that we are in the pretty town of Sidmouth
in South Devon. Somebody wishes for a jet bead
to replace one missing from a bracelet, and we sally forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in quest of a jeweller’s shop, but come first upon that of
his cousin the lapidary, which may probably do as well.
Entering the doorway, a gigantic “snakestone” from
Whitby, flanks the threshold on one side; and on the
other a lump of iron ore, of some two hundred weight,
keeps company with a quartz agate of equally cyclopean
dimensions. These are striking objects: and instinctively
we pause for a moment and consider whence they
came. One of them has been washed out of the ribs of
the conglomerate: another, after being dug from the bowels
of the earth, was sent aloft by the miners as lumber: the
third, once the shell of a living ammonite, must have
lain for thousands of years in its cemetery of limestone
rock, and was only disinterred when some northern contractor,
reckless probably of fossil remains, but wide-awake
to the actualities of his own generation, was excavating
for a railway tunnel. Inland productions these, for the
most part. But the threshold is only introductory: pass
a few steps onward, and we shall handle substances which
are as strictly marine as “crassicornis” or tangle.</p>

<p>The interior of the shop is fitted up with a massive
semicircular dresser of elm or maple, some four feet in
height, and perhaps half as many in width. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
heaped with specimens culled from various beaches, and
several convenient shelves are similarly adorned; the
polished stones lying in open trays, but set at an angle
so as best to reflect the light. The eyeless head of a
Saurian, a creature belonging to an extinct race, is suspended
from the ceiling; and a stuffed cormorant, a well-known
sea-bird of our own day, mounted on a rude tripod
of fir-bough, fills the only spare niche in the apartment.
But there is no study or affectation in all this: it is as
genuine as the tent of shipwrecked Crusoe. The lapidary
has from the first felt himself at home with Nature, and
has found room for many of her devices and eccentricities,
which he could not now bear to turn out of doors.
Neither are we inclined to quarrel with him about his arrangements,
though his shop exhibits nothing which will
remind us of a frontage in Pall Mall or Bond Street.
Moreover, when we look a little closer, he is not such a
mere dreamer after all. Commerce has not been forgotten,
nor is a certain kind of elegance lacking. Those
well-washed panes of crown-glass are decorated with
wisps of dried sea-weed more delicate than ostrich-feathers,
and which serve the purpose of a hygrometer.
And, interspersed with these, are sundry nuggets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
amber, bones of the cuttle-fish for your pounce-box, and
a string of veritable jet-beads: from which latter we at
once select our purchase.</p>

<p>But we are now standing before the central counter,
and our attention is drawn to the curious and beautiful
fossils which lie upon it. We take up one to which the
late Dr. Mantell kindly gave the name of a “choanite.”
In doing this, he not only adopted a foundling, but conferred
endless benefit upon the lapidaries. Nothing will
sell in this country without <em>a name</em>: the appellation
chosen by the Doctor was judged suitable, and a large
and increasing sale of the fossil has followed upon it.
This one is of a portly size; and the lapidary, after
slicing it in two, has polished one of the flat surfaces.
The internal structure revealed by this section is not
unlike the corolla of a daisy, and at once reminds us of
the living zoophyte called “actinia bellis.” <em>Choanite</em>
means “funnel-body:” and the creature which lies here
petrified must, when alive, have been globular or pyriform,
with many tubular arms branching out from one central
trunk.</p>

<p>The petrifaction has been faithful to its prototype:
the several tubes being now charged with limestone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the space between them, once a gelatinous substance, still
retaining that appearance in a medium of semi-pellucid
chalcedony.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="240" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ALCYONIUM DIGITATUM.</p>
</div>

<p>By the side of the choanite is another fossil, which
we now call an “alcyonite:” the learned name of the
nearest living species being “alcyonium digitatum.” It
is known in the Isle of Wight as “deadman’s fingers.”
Despite the above unpleasing nickname, this is a most
beautiful fossil. Its outer form resembles that of a
branching ice-plant: while a polished section of one of
the stems shows filaments all lying in the direction of
the axis, and exhibiting in their cut ends an effect not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
unlike that of the granulations in a slice from a fresh
cucumber. When the pith, as sometimes happens, is
particoloured, I do not know a more desirable stone for
the cabinet.</p>

<p>Fine specimens of this are now very scarce.</p>

<p>Another of these alcyonites has been polished all
round, instead of dividing it: and the pebble being
translucent, one can almost count the fibres or tubes disposed
lengthwise.</p>

<p>Then we have a zoophyte, not <em>injected</em> as are the
choanites, but preserved bodily, in delicate gray flint. It
is an undoubted “actinia:” in every respect the same
with those pulpy individuals who are displaying their
jelly-like bodies and floral hues in many a household
aquarium. This creature once floated up and down in
shallow marine pools, or clung to banks of ribbon-weed
fringing the coast-skerries. At present, himself
of stone, he is firmly wedged in a hollow within a
large pebble, and reminds us of the words of a pretty
song:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Several silicified sponges may next be examined. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
are not exactly beautiful, but they are curiously intricate;
the once elastic tubes having stiffened into “silex” of a
light brown colour, and a horizontal section displaying
their fine reticulations.</p>

<p>A step further, and what is that handsome stone? It
is a block of Devonian jasper: scarcely so hard as the
Egyptian, but more attractive, owing to the richness of
its hues. It is striated with veins of agate, and here and
there “shot” with a dark metallic “moss” of the colour
of bloodstone. As a set off to this, the lapidary has
arranged with true taste some quaint pieces of conglomerate,
in which the nodules of chalcedony or crystals
of quartz have taken a high polish, and are agreeably relieved
by streaks of red jasper and blotches of yellow
limestone.</p>

<p>Another part of the board exhibits a score of the well-known
“echini,” which children call “sea-eggs.” These
embrace two varieties, “spatangus” and “cor anguinum;”
or, in the vernacular dialect, “fairy-loaves” and “fairy-hearts.”
A third form of the Spatangus kind, but with
a pointed cusp, is called “Galerites albogalerus.” A few
are chalcedonized: in others, a bright spar has filled up
the interior of the hollow conical shell.</p>

<p>A small open tray of twisted card contains several bits
of carnelian, and a true bloodstone from the Yorkshire
coast: while on a strip of canvas as a <i lang="fr">lit de repos</i>, lie a
cray-fish and some belemnites from the Gault formation of
the Wight, hemmed round by lustrous sharks’ teeth: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
latter now hardened into stone, and proclaiming by their
isolated condition that the jaws in which they once grew
were cartilaginous, and have therefore perished.</p>

<p>Thus the store of the lapidary comprises two main
divisions, stones <em>organic</em> and <em>inorganic</em>, of the past history
of the latter we know little; and can only judge by
surmise, upon approved geological principles. In the
former, there occur plain indications that we are not
handling either an accidental “lusus” or an embryo;
but that the structure here perpetuated was once endowed
with life, and belonged to a creature having its assigned
place in the scale of animated being.</p>

<p>Let any one fill a drawer with such specimens gathered
by himself: and, omitting the question of mere marketable
value, what jeweller’s counter can compare with it for
real interest? The oriental gems, though they gleam as
if “all air and fire,” are but dead crystals, and have never
stood higher than they stand now: whereas these pretty
fossils from our wave-beaten coast tell each a wondrous
tale, and form a kind of tangible link between the zoophyte
of to-day and his far-removed ancestry in the earliest
seas which washed the surface of our globe.</p>

<p>But let us now look into the back-parlour, where all
the cutting and polishing takes place. A peep behind
the scenes is generally instructive.</p>

<p>The first time I ever entered such a “sanctum,” I
remained there nearly an hour; <em>asking questions</em>, you
may be sure.</p>

<p>The lapidary works by means of wheels. These wheels
are instruments for sawing and filing the stones which
come under his hand: he has nothing to add to them,
but a good deal to take away from them. When any one
divides an orange with a sharp knife <em>equatorially</em>, he
treats it as a choanite is treated in the simplest case: but
the principle is somewhat different. The knife may cut
the first as smooth as cheese, owing to the superior
hardness of the steel and the compressibility of the
fruit: but no instrument that man can invent will ever
do this with a substance like flint or jasper. All that the
wheel can do is to act like a saw, and to take out from the
centre of the pebble, in the shape of saw-dust, a section
equal in thickness to the wheel itself. If this be effected,
and no more, then that part of the work is perfectly
done: and this is not effected, without some fault, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in a dozen times, unless the workman be both skilful
and attentive. The usual fault is, that the plane of section
is not kept perfectly horizontal.</p>

<p>But let us now see how the wheels act. There must
always be two of them: one which is to cut by its edge,
and another which is to polish by its surface. But the
lapidary is generally provided with several of both kinds;
partly in case of accident, partly on account of variety
in the texture of the pebbles brought to him. Each
wheel is fixed upon an axis of its own, of perhaps a
cubit’s length. And this portable axis is bevelled as a
screw, for some inches, at the other end, so that it can be
screwed at pleasure into a solid revolving spindle planted
upright in the floor of the workshop. The spindle itself
may either be worked by a leathern strap and a treddle;
or, as is more usual, by a winch-handle acting at a
mechanical advantage.</p>

<p>The horizontal wheel being made to spin round by
turning the winch with one hand, the workman grasps
the pebble firmly in the other, and presses it against the
edge of the disk, which revolving in a horizontal plane
acts like a saw. A pencil-line may first be drawn on the
stone, to mark out the intended section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is not all. A <em>dry</em> wheel, although it were
formed of the finest steel, could barely scratch the surface
of an agate: or, if great force were exerted at the
winch, would splinter it. The lapidary has need of diamond-powder,
emery, and rotten-stone. He makes use
also of a peculiar kind of oil, and has a jar of water
within reach for ordinary purposes. The oil is called
“brick-oil.” It comes from coal-tar, and does not heat
by friction, as common oil would: consequently, it neither
burns the operator’s fingers, nor injures his specimens by
causing the wheel to glow too fiercely. Of the above
materials, the most expensive is the diamond. Although
obtained by crushing “bort,” of little intrinsic
value, it never costs the lapidary less than twenty-five
shillings per <i lang="la">carat</i>; and he can do nothing without it.
Emery, on the other hand, which is a coarse variety of
corundum, is cheap enough.</p>

<p>The first wheel put on the spindle is an extremely thin
one, it can scarcely be too thin, and is made of tin or of
the <em>softest</em> steel. Its disk should lie exactly level in the
plane of the horizon, and it must not have the shadow of
a notch or bend upon its delicate edge. This wheel the
lapidary wets, along its entire rim, with oil or water, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
means of a feather. A small portion of the diamond,
ready mixed with oil, is then applied to the edge of the
wheel, the latter being made to revolve gently, until it has
taken up the mixture from his finger.</p>

<p>The wheel thus primed is now set in motion, at first
slowly, but by degrees more rapidly, and the pebble being
steadily pressed, not <em>pushed</em>, against it, the diamond eats
into the metal, and the metallic edge armed with an adamantine
tooth eats into the solid stone, and at length
saws it asunder.</p>

<p>In this way an agate of a couple of inches diameter,
and of average hardness, will be neatly divided in less
than a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>The two surfaces thus obtained are then inspected, and
if the stone be judged worthy, the lapidary proceeds to
<em>polish</em> either or both of them. There is always some
difference between the two, a slice having been taken out
of the pebble answering to the thickness of the wheel;
hence the importance of using a delicate disk, especially
for valuable agates.</p>

<p>To accomplish the polishing, the thin wheel of steel is
now exchanged for a much thicker one of lead, which
takes its place upon the spindle. It is no longer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
edge, but the ribbed upper surface which is now to do
the work; and to charge it for this, it is smeared over
with rotten-stone dipped in water. This heavy wheel is
then set spinning at a rapid rate, and the pebble is
pressed flat upon it with great force; the heavier the
hand the better. As it slidders about, the action of the
rotten-stone, which is very fine in the grain, gives it
by degrees a high polish. And this polish is durable,
and will preserve the agate from the corroding effect of
our atmosphere.</p>

<p>Less than the above will not dress a pebble for the
cabinet. Occasionally, much more is needed. For a
very fine jasper I have seen two or three polishing wheels
employed, the last disk being always loaded with soft
rotten-stone.</p>

<p>As to the expense, it will cost from sixpence to ninepence
to cut a small pebble through; and to polish one
surface, perhaps as much more. This is supposing that
you take your specimens direct to a working lapidary. If,
instead of doing so, you leave them at a jeweller’s shop
with directions <em>to get them done</em>, you may expect to be
charged fully twice as much. Nor is this so unreasonable
as it sounds; for the man so deputed acts as your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
servant and will look to be paid for his trouble: he
must have recourse to the lapidary, and you might at
once have done so yourself.</p>

<p>To dress a large pebble, especially if a difficult stone
in the grain, is a more costly affair. It demands many
consecutive hours of labour and unremitting attention,
and involves a perceptible outlay in diamond. Moreover,
the weight of such a stone causes, by its <i lang="la">vis
inertiæ</i>, a severe strain on the machinery, which then
fares like an engine drawing a monster-train up the inclined
plane. This wear and tear of the wheels is so
serious a consideration in provincial towns, where the
supply of “plant” is limited, that few lapidaries out of
London will undertake, for any reasonable sum, to dress
the agates and close-grained jaspers when they run large.</p>

<p>One of my jaspers, a Devonshire beauty, took eight
hours of cutting and polishing in Clerkenwell; and even
this was a trifle compared to some of which I have heard
tell. Certain substances again are intrinsically teasing
to the wheel. There is a class of jaspery flints which
have a dodge or twist in their texture; the lapidary
abhors these visitors, and will not meddle with them, if
he knows it, without bargaining for extra pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>I have a great pleasure in seeing fine pebbles of my
own polished. You can stop the wheel every now and
then, and watch how the stone gets on. When the
chiaroscuro begins to come out on the coloured pattern,
the effect is like that produced by holding some
lively object before a mirror. The surface no longer
appears flat; but you obtain aërial perspective, as in a
good painting.</p>

<p>It were vain to deny that the lapidary’s acquaintance
might in time prove an expensive amusement; for
pebble-hunting is a hobby, and like all hobbies is liable
to be over-ridden. But experience begets caution. For
a score of stones which a tyro will leave on the board
to be cut, a connoisseur will not venture above two
or three.</p>

<p>Beginners, however, always run some risk, being naturally
enthusiastic; and the best way for them is to lay
down a few sound rules, and to adhere to these strictly.
One good maxim is, to pay for all work upon the spot.
Even an enthusiast will soon grow weary of parting with
ready money for mere trash.</p>

<p>Some persons set up a wheel, &amp;c., of their own, and
operate upon their treasure at home. I do not recommend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
this course to any one, unless he were the son of a
lapidary, as Achilles was “son of Peleus,” and intend to
devote himself to the occupation. For most amateurs it
will be found difficult. It is five to one that a young
hand signalizes his apprenticeship by spoiling his best
agates, cutting his fingers, and damaging his machinery.
The only advantage, as far as I know, which such a plan
may possess, is that you might try some curious experiments
in working at odd pebbles.</p>

<p>A lapidary’s implements, if complete as they ought to
be, will cost him from seven to ten pounds. About five
pounds’ worth of diamond is a very good commencing
stock. Five pounds more will fit up his shop with a
counter and drawers to lock, and his work-room with a
table, stool, hammers, a few cloths, and a good lens.
This is all that he requires, besides knowledge and patience.</p>

<p>Suppose the entire outlay should amount to twenty
pounds; in a good watering-place, on the south coast of
England, he ought to make from a hundred to a hundred
and fifty pounds a year, without doing any night-work.
But by day he must not spare hands nor eyes: and he
cannot afford to make any serious mistakes with his customers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
If he cuts a fine choanite the wrong way, or
mutilates a rare alcyonite, or robs a promising “landscape-pebble”
of its pellucid sky, it is well-nigh over with
his professional reputation; and that once gone, he will
get little custom of value. When I was last in Ventnor,
the sea had thrown up some singularly fine pebbles for
several successive tides. Three working lapidaries rented
houses in the town; but all the more valuable orders
went to one of them. This man knew admirably well
how to handle almost any stone which was brought to
him; while his two brethren in the craft, though both of
them hard-working men, were comparatively ignorant.
They were like quack-doctors, and he was a learned
professor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>THE CONTENTS OF A GOOD BEACH, AND HOW TO OBTAIN
THEM.</p>

</div>

<p>I have always been fond of trying conclusions with
Nature at first hand. When a boy at school, I learnt to
swim by following some bigger boys, who could swim
already, into water which was quite out of all our depths.</p>

<p>I had never till then tried, except in shallow places,
which, whatever people may think, afford no criterion of
how it will fare with you in a drowning current. On
this occasion we swam about fifty yards, in ten-foot
water, not without trepidation at first on my part, but
towards the end I gained breath and confidence. After
that, I never had any difficulty, whether in lakes or rivers,
and I have ventured into scores of them at all seasons,
and that without the slightest previous notice of their
depth or temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>In like manner, I am convinced that to master anything,
whether bodily or intellectual, the all-important
point is to make a genuine effort of our own. Books
may do something for us; teachers, if we can afford
them, something more; but we must do the main part
ourselves.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the above in proposing to describe a
good beach. A lapidary once said to me, “Sir, you
know this bit of the coast as well as I do myself.” It
was a high compliment, but it was not unmerited. The
truth is, I possess “memoranda,” jotted down from
time to time, of divers beaches and their usual contents,
and I find that, omitting all mention of bare reefs in
shale and sandstone, or long reaches of sand, which are
of continual occurrence, there remain some forty odd
miles of shingle lying in three different parts of the
English coast, with the character of which I am thoroughly
well acquainted.</p>

<p>Some of these beaches are very superior to others, and
I select such for description.</p>

<p>Amid countless boulders of flint, and heaps of hardened
gravel, we have upon a good beach certain smooth,
translucent pebbles, and we have fossil petrifactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
enveloped in an opaque crust, and we have the variegated
jaspers and moss-agates.</p>

<p>Our semi-pellucid stones were, with the exception of an
occasional bit of “bloodstone,” the only pebbles of
native growth known in Britain half a century ago.
They consist of two or three varieties of agate, two of
carnelian, and one of the crystal called an aquamarine.
The presence of this latter on the coast is a mere accident,
as it is for the most part a far-inland production,
the growth of granitic rocks.</p>

<p>Agates and carnelians were once of frequent occurrence,
but they have now become scarce. Their brilliancy
insures their being instantly seen, when not buried
under the loose shingle.</p>

<p>AGATE, with us, is always found smooth, and some of
the best specimens are indented on the sides, as if they
had been subjected to a pinch or pressure while in a soft
state. As this substance is not met with under the
spiked form of a crystal, we may suppose that it never
was crystallized.</p>

<p>It is not laminar, like the diamond, nor coated, like a
pearl, but one simple concretion. It contains some
alumina, but more silica, and is probably one form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the onyx-stone. It is seldom very bright, being more or
less debased with earthy particles, but it is a pretty thing
to pick up, and it takes a high polish on the wheel of the
lapidary. I believe it is harder than jasper, but perhaps
scarcely so <em>tough</em>.</p>

<p>In England, we find the agates greenish white, lemon
colour, or dark grey; and on the island of Iona, hard by
the ruined monastery, they are picked up of a soft green
hue, and as clear as a chrysolite. The best lump of
agate I ever saw came from an unfrequented bay in the
Isle of Wight; the colours were dullish, but in texture it
approached an oriental onyx, and it weighed above a
pound. I know of no equal specimen in the collection
of the British Museum.</p>

<p>CARNELIAN, which is our purest form of chalcedony,
is undoubtedly a more beautiful stone than the agate.
This is either milk-white or of a deep red. The latter tint
is becoming scarce in Britain, having been much sought
out for the manufacture of seals and ring-stones, but now
that “sards” are so much in vogue, the real carnelian
may get a respite and appear in force again, as salmon
have sometimes been known to do in their native streams
after falling off for many years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The “sard” may be considered as the carnelian of the
desert, or the “carnelian” as the sard of the seashore.
Sards are plentiful in the east. Travellers, whose path
lies over the waste plains and sandy reaches of Egypt
or Lybia, should pick up any darkly-tinted pebble they
may descry on the surface of the ground: it is probably
a sard, perchance a valuable specimen. One day, in
homely Brighton, stepping into a lapidary’s, I found
upon his counter half-a-dozen unusual-looking stones
already cut in two, and some of them polished. “These
are not English,” said I, “where did you get them?”
He told me, in reply, that a gentleman just arrived from
Egypt had taken these stones out of the mouth of his
carpet-bag and left them with him to be dressed. I examined
them closely. As I had expected, on learning the
locality, one was a blood-red sard, and two others were
jaspers; a fourth was curiously mottled and ribbed with
chalcedony. They had been obtained without any expense,
and at no trouble beyond that of stooping to
pick them up, and all four were very <em>saleable</em> articles in
the trade.</p>

<p>The finest red carnelians are brought from the East,
but they occur also in Silesia, and splendid specimens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a dark hue have been obtained from the sands of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>In Scotland, on the beach of St. Andrew’s, I found a
pretty variety, “eyed,” but it is scarce. I have since
seen similar stones, which had been picked up at Cromer
or at Aldborough.</p>

<p>The AQUAMARINE is sometimes met with on the
sea-shore at Aberystwith in North Wales, and more rarely
on our eastern coast. Of course it is a crystal, which has
come down from the inland rocks, and has afterwards
been rolled smooth by the action of the waves among
other pebbles.</p>

<p>The base of all our English crystals is <em>Silica</em>, with an
admixture of lime. Rock-crystal is the purest form of
Silica. Common spar is a carbonate of lime. The black
or grey flints, which are shed in myriads from many a
chalk-cliff, are “Silex” much debased; some dark,
viscous matter, such as bitumen, having united, I think
<em>chemically</em>, with the clearer substance. Quartz are the
small crystals of silica; a mass of these will vary in its
configuration.</p>

<p>Cairngorum stones are rock-crystals from the mountain
of that name, deeply impregnated with iron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
aluminium. The claret-coloured ones, found on Ben
M’Dhui, are our nearest approach to an amethyst, and
some deep-red specimens remind us of the garnet.</p>

<p>As I propose here to speak only of our sea-shore
pebbles, I shall not dwell upon the Scotch crystals,
which are, moreover, familiar to almost everybody in the
ornaments of tartan dresses. Neither shall I touch upon
the fluor spars of Derbyshire, or the magnificent crystals
found in the mines of Cornwall and Cumberland.</p>

<p>All these belong to crystallography, and I am persuaded
that, in our productions of the seaside, a crystallizing
process has been the exception and not the rule.
I will only add to what is said above, that, as far as I
know, amidst the great range of tints comprised in the
different crystals from Scotland and from Ireland, there
is no instance of the <em>peach-colour</em> or delicate pink, such
as are picked up on some of the “moraines” on the Alps
of Savoy.</p>

<p>Secondly, such parts of our coast as are hemmed in
by cretaceous or sandstone cliffs abound in fossil pebbles.
The organisms which these inclose are, almost universally,
those of zoophytes. Dendritic or vegetable markings
are rare, occurring principally in the white chalcedony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
A good pebble of this kind used to be called a
mocha-stone; the difficulty always was how to be quite
sure where it came from. Those from the Indies would
generally be handsomer; while, on the other hand, an
equally fine specimen from our own shores would be
of treble value.</p>

<p>But the petrifactions described in Chapter II. may
be readily obtained throughout the entire range of coast
from Hastings to Selsea Bill, and further.</p>

<p>In gathering these pebbles, if you intend them for the
cabinet, and not merely to amuse a passing hour, regard
should be had to three points; the size, the pattern, and
the colour. The last-mentioned, which is, nine times out
of ten, the cause of average specimens being seen at all,
will itself be determined by the material of which the
pebble consists. Chalcedony has a bluish cast in the
solid stone, especially when it is wet with brine; but
where “moss” is present, this will cause a golden or red
tint. Jasper, when semi-transparent, is greenish, otherwise,
a blood-red.</p>

<p>As to size, choanites and the globular “sponges” will
vary from that of a small pippin to that of a full-sized
orange. Very rarely they exceed this. If the pebble be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the right sort, the larger the better: but, as a general
rule, the finer ones run small.</p>

<p>The pattern is the most important feature; as you will
soon recognize in making a collection. And this, moreover,
if no injury has yet been done to the stone, decides
the “contour” of the rolling beauty.</p>

<p>I shall not, however, say much about these patterns;
not wishing to be charged with exaggeration, as I probably
should be, by those who have never seen good ones,
and who do not conceive of the endless varieties into
which four or five colours can thus be wrought in the
stony loom of Nature.</p>

<p>Amateurs must learn for themselves what these really
are, and how to judge of them scientifically, when they
pick up a fossil weighing, perhaps, a pound avoirdupois,
and looking like a champion-potato. One or two hints
may be ventured. If the creature was an “alcyonite,”
its <i lang="la">facsimile</i> in stone should have the external rings or
mouths clearly defined, and, if possible, equi-distant.
Such a one, when cut, will exhibit its tubes evenly disposed—not
unlike a section of fir-wood under the microscope.
If it was an “actinia,” then the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
zoophyte should be central in the pebble, and the tentacles
will be not much melted away in a good slice.</p>

<p>“Sponges” must be chosen principally for their
colour; in other words, for the <em>texture</em> of the stone.
Those which exhibit the reticulations, white or straw-colour,
upon a very dark ground, are the most effective
generally: but the most perfect one I ever saw had a
blood-red pattern upon white. For a single <em>slice</em> from
this stone, half a guinea was offered by me, and refused.</p>

<p>“Choanites” are easily discerned.</p>

<p>The “ventriculite” must have been a creature lower
down in that scale than the choanite. This fossil is
repeatedly met with on our coast, but I do not admire it
enough to have retained a single specimen. When alive,
it would appear to have resembled, in stature and configuration,
an ordinary toadstool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="500" height="475" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VENTRICULITE. CHOANITE.</p>
</div>

<p>The choanite was, undoubtedly, a beautiful creature,
and, as ten thousand of the family testify, abundant.
Dr. Mantell said that its form, when complete, was that
of a pear or fig, and I think he obtained such a fossil
from the Lewes chalk, where it was growing upright on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a stalk, in the way in which he afterwards depicted it.
Looking over my collection, I see that I have a similar
one, in black chalcedony-flint, which I picked up at
Shanklin; only, in my specimen, which came from the
beach, the delicate stem is, of course, gone.</p>

<p>The complete pyriform mound is rare, for obvious
reasons. I never saw but three instances of it; the
above, of my own finding, was one. Another was in
pellucid white agate, spotted all over with the ends of
the feelers. The third, which I also picked up, had been
pounded on a rough beach, and crumbled in my hand.</p>

<p>Choanites and ventriculites, as animals, are supposed
to be extinct. Perhaps they are so, though I do not see
how any one can take upon him to pronounce as to what
living organisms the great Southern Ocean may or may
not contain.</p>

<p>The creature, however, which I admire most, as perpetuated
in these marine fossils, is not a choanite, but an
actinia of the “crass” kind. One of these, large and
of a globular form, in which the tubular tentacles are
distinctly shown, and the colour is yellow in the agate, I
found, in a sequestered spot, where the deep sand must
have received and sheltered it shortly after it had dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
from the cliff. The outer whitey-brown crust was unbroken:
and as this crust is the cuticle of the pebble,
and which always wears away first, I have no doubt of
the specimen being a perfect one. It could never have
undergone a rub, beyond that from soft sand or softer
seaweed.</p>

<p>Lastly, striped jaspers and bloodstones are to be had
for the seeking, on our Devonshire and Yorkshire coasts.
The bloodstone is too well known to need any description;
neither is there much variety or interest in a rush-green,
spotted with red. But the jaspers embrace several
other colours, and many lively patterns. South Devon
has good ones, resembling agatized wood. Scarborough
has good ones, some of them quite equal to the “weed-agate”
of India. At Eastbourne, a dark-brown variety
is occasionally found, which is highly prized, because it
approaches the character of the Egyptian. Fine pebbles
of this kind are also to be obtained in the neighbourhood
of St. Alban’s, in Hertfordshire, but they are liable to be
gritty.</p>

<p>Beside the above, which are true jaspers, scores of
jasper-flints in bright red, yellow, or green, occur on
almost any beach. These are simply burnt flints, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a portion of oxide of iron. Their present condition
is probably the result of extinct volcanic agency.
These are not nearly so hard as the true jaspers, and
their <em>fracture</em> is “conchoidal.”</p>

<p>For pleasing the eye, perhaps the choicest stone in
Britain is a moss-agate, of which the pretty name yields
an accurate description. The “moss” is some oxidized
metal, whose ramifications form a striking contrast with
the limpid chalcedony in which it seems to float like
seaweed or sponge.</p>

<p>When a fine specimen of one of these stones has been
cleverly cut, it is not unusual to obtain in its section the
principal features of a mimic landscape—the clear sky,
and the fuscous earth. Some, in addition, display a
setting sun, &amp;c. Such stones get the name of “landscape-pebbles.”</p>

<p>On the shores of Loch Tay, in Perthshire, remarkable
ones are found—in which the imaginative Highlander
fancies he can trace the features of his beloved mountain-scenery.
Great store is set by these, on account of
their pattern; but they are mostly in sepia, and white,
being never suffused with warm colours, as are our
marine specimens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>I may note here, finally, that to a true connoisseur,
the prettiest moss-agates are not so welcome as those
which exhibit a bold and haggard style. Some of the
French pebbles, from the neighbourhood of Dieppe,
would be very fine indeed, only that they are spoiled
by an undue quantity of black “moss,” as black as
mud.</p>

<p>Most of the above-named treasures may be obtained by
any one who owns a fair amount of perseverance, provided
he or she have an eye for pebbles. And nobody
need be discouraged from the search, who likes them well
enough to be willing to take a good deal of trouble to
find them. One-half of what are counted difficulties
in this life have their root and growth in our constitutional
laziness, and may be overcome by a little energy.
We have all of us an eye for ripe cherries and red roses,
why not for pebbles?</p>

<p class="tb">Let me now state in a few brief paragraphs the merits
of the case. People say there is luck in all things. It
may be so, once or twice; I never knew it hold for a
continuance. A course of practical experience in almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
any department of life will bring a sure quietus to such
crude fancies.</p>

<p>The searcher after pebbles must look to more sterling
qualifications. He should have good legs, good eyes,
good judgment, and—I may as well say it at once—a
good temper. He should choose a likely part of an unfrequented
beach: and should go down at the right hour,
somewhere about half-tide, when the tide <em>is running
out</em>.</p>

<p>It is as well for him to walk with the sun a little behind
him, and on one side; and I would recommend him, if
possible, to avoid entertaining a north-easter in his teeth.</p>

<p>Then he should be suitably rigged for the expedition.
If he has ever fished salmon, he will need no wrinkles
here: but in case not, I may specify the following.
Strong ancle-boots, with double soles and on real hob-nails,
and a stout woollen sock within; rough trowsers,
which he will not grudge damping in the brine; and a
coat of fustian or tweed, with ample pockets. When the
season is wintry, add to these a warm wrapper for the
neck; and, in one of his pockets, a Cording’s india-rubber
cape with sleeves. A water-proof cap, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
curtain to it. No umbrella, no stick; but a light geologist’s
hammer; and a canvas-bag, worked with open
meshes, for the heavier specimens, which otherwise he
would have to carry in his hand.</p>

<p>If he is going far, and it is as well to count upon
eight or ten miles from home, let him carry a flask of
any liquid he likes best to imbibe; together with a
hunch of bread and cheese. [N.B. This will be found
more sustaining than a meat-sandwich.] Lastly, a few
mild cigars, not omitting the usual implements for striking
a light <i lang="la">sub dio</i>. The fragrant weed is always a
cheerful companion, and doubly welcome when your path
lacks flowers: moreover, it has historical associations,
which cabbages have not, and will bring to mind Sir
Walter Raleigh, who was a great man.</p>

<p>The above rules concerning the toilet will hold good
for the fair sex, <i lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>. Only in addition,
ladies should engage some stalwart arm to lean upon;
and should on no account venture themselves among
slippery rocks. As for those knights and esquires who
accompany the gentle dames on such a quest, they must
look to themselves. I cannot now stop to warn them of
their peculiar peril; but they know what I mean. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
was among the Ocean-isles that Briseis led captive the
stern son of Peleus.</p>

<p>Above all, let the Pebble-searcher have nothing on
his mind when he sets forth: no broken engagements,
no crying debts. Otherwise, he may look in vain for
moss-agates. Shakspeare, when he has to account for a
valiant warrior and politic general, a crowned king to
boot, losing the great battle of Bosworth-field, ascribes
it all to the ghosts who sat heavy on his soul. Any neglected
or injured creature may prove on such occasions a
vengeful ghost.</p>

<p>Supposing your hours free, the best are those in which
the daylight is most powerful: say, from ten in the
morning until four in the afternoon; or, to take things in
moderation, from eleven to three. A beaching expedition
made thus with determinate purpose, once or twice
in the course of six days, I hold to be reasonable diversion;
and for matter of interest, I know of no out-door
pursuit which excels it, not even Insect-catching, or Fly-fishing.</p>

<p>The above hints being attended to, one important
point remains still to be considered. It is absolutely necessary
to understand pebbles in the rough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The more peculiar a beach is in its contents, the less
will it exhibit to catch the eyes of one who has never
learnt to appreciate them. Coloured seaweeds are enticingly
bright; pearly shells are as evident as trinkets;
but the external coat of a genuine pebble differs widely
from its internal structure, and may yield to the uninitiated
no indication whatever of the value of the latter.
A crust of hardened lime or sandstone is a frequent envelope
of the best specimens in one kind of zoophyte.
The stone itself is very likely mis-shapen, and perhaps
lies more than half buried in sand or shingle. Without
knowing anything of the nature of these fossils, you
may occasionally pick up such “darkies” at a venture;
but you will never feel assured of them, you will never be
able to glean them from the multitudinous gravel, as the
determined Fly-fisher gets the best trout out of a pool,
if you have not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance
with their species. The readiest way of acquiring this,
and it is not born with anybody, is to spend a wakeful
half-hour, once and again, at the board of any civil lapidary,
and there thoroughly to inspect his casual store.
A trifling purchase will abundantly content him in return,
the more as he hopes to cut several pebbles for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe, then the peculiar way in which the outer crust
of an old pebble is worn, as compared with that of one
which has newly descended upon the beach. This crust
or cuticle is highly suggestive, if you can once come to
understand it; and as a hopeful indication of progress,
you may safely assume that you <em>do</em> understand it, when
you find that you can obtain pebbles such as nine persons
out of ten somehow never “have the luck” to meet with.
Sometimes a stone has parted with its original coating,
and has donned another: and this operation may
either be complete, or still <i lang="la">in fieri</i>. In the latter case,
there will always be some token; either by the substance
not lying evenly, or by a change in the colour of the
second envelope, which becomes apparent on chipping off
a fragment from its surface.</p>

<p>Lose no opportunity of perfecting your judgment upon
any form or texture that comes in your way: for upon
this will really depend what sort of collection you shall
win from the bosom of the coy beach. Nothing is
easier, on an average coast, than to pick up a score of
showy-looking but inferior stones. Few things will be
found more difficult than to bring home, as the fruit of
your morning’s walk, two or three valuable specimens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
And the cause of this lies not at all in luck, nor altogether
in mere labour; for in all departments there are
dunces who will still drudge hard. It lies in the presence
or absence of sound information on the subject.</p>

<p>A good rule is, even early in your apprenticeship, to
eschew trumpery. But beware of hasty conclusions.
Some collectors will take nothing away with them from
the beach which they do not feel quite sure about. This
is shallow practice, for it assumes an amount of discernment
which nobody possesses. I can see as far into a
stone wall in this sense as most people; but I rather like
to carry off occasionally an odd-looking stone which, like
Bassanio’s happy casket, “rather threatens than doth
promise aught.” Such a pebble may turn out a prize.
The things which every one should reject without hesitation
are those whose character is evident, and with it
their little worth.</p>

<p>Mediocrity in pebbles is insufferable. Do not assume
that the <em>wet</em> portion of a beach necessarily yields the best
chances. Many pebble-hunters never get over this early
delusion. On a coast which is rarely trodden, the upper
range contains the richest store. And in every case, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
tide runs twice in the twenty-four hours over banks which
now look dry and dusty, as well as over that narrow strip
which you see glistening with saline moisture. And
while you cannot fail to remark a pellucid stone or fossil
which is sprinkled by the wave, if your attention is
caught by anything lying high and dry, the latter is probably
worth stooping for.</p>

<p>Walk rapidly over a poor, unproductive beach; but
take your time and make good use of your eyes when
you find you are in the land of plenty.</p>

<p>If you carry a hammer with you, let it be of the right
sort; a well-tempered metal, not too large to stow away
in a hind-pocket, and <em>not armed with a spike</em>. When
you have such a one, it is tolerably safe to strike even a
heavy blow on a large pebble in your other hand; but if
you do the same by a small one, you may chance to maim
your left palm for life: because in this case there is little
reaction, and the blow you deal will <em>drive</em> the stone. But
even with large pebbles, the preferable method is to plant
one foot firmly on the stone, leaving a portion exposed to
your aim. If your boots are of a sensible thickness,
nothing will come to grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Never dash pebbles down upon others in order to break
them open. In the first place, you risk a wound in your
face from the rebound of a fragment in what mathematicians
term the “angle of reflexion,” an angle which you
have probably not calculated; but besides this, you may
by such imprudence destroy a valuable specimen. You
can open plenty of fossil flints and waterworn jaspers in
the manner I have recommended above; which knocks
off a corner, and shows you the true nature of the formations
you are walking upon. I have learned a good deal
in this way.</p>

<p>Lastly, when you are landed upon a superior beach,
with the promise of a few hours of open weather, use the
golden opportunity and do your best.</p>

<p>Solomon was quite right when he said, “Whatever
thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.” It is evident
that if you do not <i lang="la">in foro conscientiæ</i> think such
a hobby worth the while, you ought not to meddle with
it. I quite agree that making shoes is more profitable,
provided always that you have custom; although I have
known more than one instance of working craftsmen
who at intervals picked up some very good pebbles too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The above rules may sound marvellously simple. I
only wish that a few as simple were generally acted upon.
We might then hope to see some noble collections of
really instructive pebbles from our as yet little known sea-coast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>WHICH BE THE BEST BEACHES IN ENGLAND.—CONCERNING
STATIONARY AND MOVABLE SHINGLES.</p>

</div>

<p>The variety exhibited by Nature seems to be almost
infinite, take what ground we will for observation and
comparison. This has been frequently noted in both the
animal and vegetable departments of Creation. I believe
it to be no less true of the mineral, especially when we
embrace under that head fossil remains.</p>

<p>If there be any feature in British scenery which to a
cursory observer appears uniform and identical everywhere,
it is the yellow-looking beach along the coast line.
Yet it will be found on trial that our beaches differ widely
from each other. No two are quite alike. Devonshire
is not more diverse from Yorkshire, or Norfolk from the
Isle of Wight, than are their respective beaches, as to
what these contain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Nay more: on the range of the Sussex coast—a very
monotonous range—I am acquainted, at this present time
of writing, with four beaches, which I do not scruple to
pronounce totally different one from another. If I were
shown the pebbles, I could generally tell from which
quarter they came. But to become aware of variety, you
must observe certain admitted facts. The frequenters of
our coast-scenery, not one-tenth part of whom can plead
the sad excuse of being invalids, usually know but little of
the character of a beautiful beach lying in their intermediate
neighbourhood. Ordinarily speaking, a man
will be better informed concerning the plains of the
Pampas, or the windings of the Coppermine River, than
he is upon the nature of the soil which is under his feet,
or of the bough which hangs over his head in the forest.
And the reason of this is obvious; we neglect the reality
for the sake of the appearance. We greedily devour
certain stereotyped works as a kind of royal road to
knowledge; but we omit to notice and inquire into the
sensible objects which are strewn along our daily path.</p>

<p>Of course, we pay the penalty in kind. Two-thirds of
our “book-knowledge” is merely conceited ignorance;
not the genuine gold, fit for current coin, but a baser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
metal washed over, which will stand no one in stead for
long.</p>

<p>I will now describe accurately three beaches which
occur in three different counties. Any one who makes
their acquaintance hereafter, especially if in quest of
pebbles, will, I believe, recognize the original of each
sketch. One of them now lies far away; but to think of
them is like dwelling on the still vivid impressions of a
dream.</p>

<p>I am in a district of the New Red Sandstone, and as
far as my eye can reach I see towering cliffs of a kindred
formation, wheeling round or jutting out in foxy-coloured
masses, while the innumerable points of shingle glow
like an autumn stubble at their feet. I commence searching
near the bright water-line, and what with the simple
grandeur of the scene, and what with the balmy breath
of the south, I insensibly stray onward for several miles,
until the increasing weight in my pockets suggests a
pause. Now I will sit down under the shadow of that
mid-way rock, light a cigar, and inspect my treasures.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. What a calming sensation
a whiff of good tobacco induces on these burning
days! But what have I got? Above thirty globes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
chalcedony, blue and white, as oval as bantams’ eggs. I
select half a dozen on account of some beauty or peculiarity,
and fling the remainder into the sea, there to
undergo a fresh impregnation. Next, sundry bits of the
red and white conglomerate. Let me advise everybody
who has the opportunity, to pick this up. When sliced
and polished, the surface obtained beats the inlaid work
of a cabinet-maker all to nothing. Next, a couple of
choanites, one in the dark “rag,” ribbed like sea-weed;
the other in pretty light-brown moss-agate. These two
go into my breast-pocket for safety. Lastly, what has
never been out of my hand since I found it—a huge,
knotted jasper-agate, of five pounds’ weight.</p>

<p>I will only add that the beach here described is a first-rate
one in its way, although not my absolute favourite.
I had, however, never seen it before, and have never
visited it since; moreover, I had not a hammer with me,
nor any refreshment beyond a cigar, after tramping over
many miles of deep shingle; consequently, I do not suppose
I did justice to the contents of that bit of coast.</p>

<p>But where am I now? Two hundred miles away, and
the scene is changed. I have just rounded a headland,
on whose summit the ripening corn-field is waving and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
gleaming like the tuft on the head of a woodpecker.
Dizzy precipices of chalk stand like sugar-loaves against
the blue sky, here and there cleft in a tortuous, yawning
chasm. Beneath, the beach seems to slumber, so gentle
is that lisping murmur, where the long billowy swell
washes the face of the skerries, and lifts up and down
their heavy fringe of tangle like a giant’s beard. Two
hours are mine, as we mortals reckon, before I am expected
at the evening meal. This time I have my hammer
with me—no clumsy carpenter’s tool, which might
rend or splinter, but a tempered steel.</p>

<p>I did but walk a couple of miles in all. I found sundry
pieces of perfectly white agate, one of which proved
good enough for a seal. I broke open a score or two of
jaspers, and was rewarded at last by a fine slab of the
rich brown (quasi-Egyptian). Then I hunted up from
the shingle a pocketful of “sponges,” and a choanite in
dark purple flint, which is rare. And then time was up,
and scaling the cliff by a well-known gap and pathway,
I returned home to crab-pie and a cup of tea, and the
welcome of a dear, kind face. This part of our coast is
much visited now by pebble-seekers.</p>

<p>Now I have crossed a channel of the sea, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
looked upon the mighty three-deckers, and all the flower
of the yachtery of England; and I have strolled through
a smart modern town, and have passed a meditative half-hour
in a very ancient village, and then, at a sharp turn,
I have quitted the high-road, with its hot milestones, and
picked my way through a blossoming lane where the
nightingales were singing; and I have scrambled over
the edge of a snipe-bog, and hurried past the mouth of a
diluvian estuary, and here I am, stretched at full length
on the choicest bit of beach in all the realm of Queen
Victoria. In front of me are soaring pinnacles of chalk,
ribbed and dotted with primeval flints, like the gun-muzzles
in an upper deck. Behind me rises another
barrier, formed of the dark “greensand;” and on one
side, for the space of a mile, these lofty brows have
dipped and disappeared, that the red edge of the wealden
might crop out from a wide tract of rush-grown water-meadows.
Through the heart of these latter steals a
rivulet, beloved of stray wild-fowl, but not tenanted by
anything so lively as a trout.</p>

<p>The position of this beach is all that can be desired,
and its contents will not disappoint expectation. It has
sometimes reminded me of one of those angular nooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
formed externally by the converging hedges of a cover
and a crop, where you are sure to meet with the hares
and pheasants which have come out to feed on your
wheat-stubble or turnips. Here, however, instead of the
scuttling game, you must look for matchless pebbles.</p>

<p>Often as I have paced this charming strand, the occasion
of my first stepping upon it was pure accident, as,
indeed, are some of the pleasantest turns in life. I remember
one summer’s day, when the solid cliffs seemed
to be pulverizing under the heat, and the air-vessels in
exposed sheaves of bladderwrack were splitting and popping
like crackers, I found four or five specimens within
a couple of hundred yards which I have never since surpassed,
seldom equalled. Two of these were <em>deep red</em>
choanites, conveying the idea, not of dull “oxide,” but
that the animal’s blood had suffused the agate; another
was a particoloured madrepore, another, a moss-jasper.</p>

<p>This bay, however, possesses peculiar advantages. In
addition to the fossils which drop from time to time out
of its own overhanging cliffs, it is fed in a remarkable
manner from other sources.</p>

<p class="tb">Until of late years, Sussex has been the usual resort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of those who desired to collect pebbles for the cabinet.
The capabilities of this coast vary with every twenty
miles. The Brighton beach was once famous for the
supply of “landscape-pebbles;” but in the lapse of
years its fecundity has been sadly impaired. The best
chance remaining now is that of an occasional waif
during the March winds on the sweep fronting Brunswick
Terrace, and for about half a mile toward
Shoreham.</p>

<p>Bognor has long reefs of rock at low water, and, by
the usual rule, it ought to yield petrified sponges; for
I think that, generally speaking, the locality determines
the animal. But the infirmity of the Bognor shore is,
that its pebbles are chafed and worn to skeletons by the
furious storms which assail this unprotected coast in
winter. No fossil with a delicate constitution can long
withstand the effect of these gales and plunging seas.</p>

<p>Off Beachey-head, in the other direction, is found a
variety which I have not met with elsewhere. The
specimen shown to me was vermicular; the creature,
which had perhaps been a “sabella,” lying in distinct
coils, not unlike <i lang="it">macaroni</i>, in the blue agate. This
pebble was a very large and perfect one; and the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
who had picked it up, and paid perhaps half-a-guinea
for the dressing of it, was desirous to realize a five-pound
note. I wish much that it had found its way
to the British Museum. There is no stone there resembling
it.</p>

<p>At Deal and Ramsgate, “fortification-agates” may be
readily met with, and sometimes a bit of carnelian: but
this last, bright and homogeneous, is rare. The Hastings
beach is mainly worn out. Aldborough, in Suffolk,
was wont to be famous for its coloured agates; and Fifeshire,
and part of Forfarshire, for eyed jaspers: but many
years have gone by since I visited either of these counties,
and I would not venture to speak with confidence
concerning their actual beaches now.</p>

<p>Very good pebbles are picked up at Cromer; and,
occasionally, carnelians, both red and white. Felixstowe,
a little lower down the coast than Aldborough,
abounds in yellow agates, some of them beautifully
translucent, and rivalling the carnelian in smoothness
of texture. At Scarborough, remarkable specimens both
of the agates and jaspers are obtained by those who
know where to look for them. Filey has the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
charms for enticing strangers to wander onwards along
its pretty coast. Indeed, all the Yorkshire beaches
deserve and will repay a visit, both in fossils and
transparencies.</p>

<p>Carnelians are peculiar stones as to their habits, if I
may use such an expression in speaking of inanimate
substances. It were absurd to doubt that plenty of
them still haunt our English coast; but where they
manage to hide themselves has often perplexed me.
The method of searching for them is as follows. Instead
of keeping the sun behind you, he should now be
full in front, like a candle in your eyes. But you must
not look at the sun: you must look along the surface
of the beach; and whenever a bit of carnelian peeps
out from the shingle, you will at once descry it, owing
to the position of the great light.</p>

<p>I tried this once at Blackgang Chine for three-quarters
of an hour, and in the course of that time I filled both
my waistcoat-pockets with red bits. It is true, none of
these were larger than pudding-raisins, and some of
them scarcely more brilliant; still, the search was very
diverting. If the shingle had not been unusually damp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I might have lain down every now and then and looked
along its surface; in which case I should, doubtless, have
succeeded better.</p>

<p>The mention of Blackgang leads me to speak of the
Isle of Wight, as the choicest storehouse for this kind
of fossils in Britain.</p>

<p class="tb">If it be true, as some geologists aver, that the pearly
“Vectis” was at one time joined on to our Hampshire
coast, from which it afterwards broke off like a loose
morsel from the side of a cake, that would go far to
explain the abundance and beauty of its organisms.
For, upon such a separation from the mainland, the
industrious sea would have great opportunities of denuding
the face of the cliffs and sucking the orifices
of the chines. Also, this circumambient sea is peculiar
in its character hereabouts; and the crystallizing waves
impart an unusual lustre to rolling agates and jaspers.</p>

<p>The beaches of the Wight are circumscribed in extent,
which is a great relief after the interminable ranges on
the Sussex coast. The difference is as great as that between
a quiet forenoon spent in the museum in Jermyn
Street, and the laborious distractions experienced if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pass a similar interval of time amidst the endless rooms
and innumerable cases on the first floor of the British
Museum.</p>

<p>The village of Sandown, from the flag-staff on as far as
Red Cliff and Culver, exhibits a tempting and instructive
shore. In winter, it is better to commence at the dyke,
and end with Red Cliff; but in summer, you may walk
the whole range with advantage. Here, a couple of
hours may be taken to as many miles; and if you do
not shut your eyes, you must fill your pockets. But
look with resolution for good ones.</p>

<p>From Sandown to Shanklin, in the opposite direction,
it is scarcely inferior. It was once even better; but, lying
so near at hand, it has been unceasingly hunted over;
and to look for a fine pebble there now, is almost like
hoping to find a hare sitting in your kitchen-garden.
Many tons’ weight of beautiful fossils have been gathered
within the compass of a morning’s walk here, in the last
few years.</p>

<p>At the foot of Shanklin Chine occurs a singular collection
of limestone pebbles, siliceous within, which are
well worth examining. Extraordinarily-tinted choanites
are here sometimes detected in the heart of most unattractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and mis-shapen blocks. I once asked a successful
beaching lapidary there, how he <em>knew</em> them?
He declared that he did not know them at all; but
that whenever he saw fresh bonzes thrown up, especially
if with a deep-sea mark upon them, he would
break them all, and generally obtained a superb specimen
among them. The objection to this murderous
process was, as he confessed, that some of the finest
were wont to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Latterly, I thought I discovered a way to recognize
the presence of any such choanite. It is to look closely
for a peculiar depression in the stone which is connected
with the principal <em>air-hole</em> belonging to the fossil. But
this method demands time and care.</p>

<p>Onwards to Luccombe, the beach disappears, owing, I
imagine, to immovable depth of sand. At Luccombe
Chine, it partially revives: but do not linger here. Go
on to Bonchurch, and as you approach that lovely hillside,
rouse all your energies. Here comes in a mile of
sand, small shingle, and half-buried pebbles, which will
put your skill to the test, if skill you have. Look out
for symptoms of the “tubular” structure, and diverge
now and then to the pools among those weedy rocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Many a beautiful “actinia” in flint lies there snug
enough, wedged in a dark cranny, and coated over with
glutinous moss. You must really not be idle now.
Do not even light a cigar, but hammer and delve and
scrape away; only do not give in until you lay hold of
something worth the while. Two zoophytes, of the
agatine-siliceous kind, were picked up on this spot about
a twelvemonth since, for which large sums of money were
offered in Ventnor the same day. For one of this sort,
an American gentleman, not long ago, gave eight pounds
sterling. But there is in Brighton, or was till very
recently, a pebble from the Rottingdean beach, for which
fifty guineas have been offered to its possessor, and
refused. I have not seen it myself, but I am told that
it is a spotted pyriform choanite; the material, very
beautiful agate.</p>

<p>At Ventnor, red gravel and diminutive carnelians,
some of them not bigger than pins’ heads, await the
pebble-seeker. Occasionally an agate is found here
which is “chatoyant,” like an opal, but this is scarce.</p>

<p>I once tried the Freshwater strand, “ultima thule,” but
I only met with doubtful, ragged flints. The north side
of the island presents on its shores a surface chiefly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
mud and estuary drift, delightful to solans and sea-gulls,
but not profitable for the cabinet of the mineralogist.</p>

<p>I ought here, in common gratitude, to say something
of the beauties of the Garden Isle. But, though some
of the happiest hours of my life have been passed there,
I grudge to dilate upon the theme. I could not, if I
would, convey to a stranger a sense of the unutterable
attachment which I feel for its swelling downs and
curling seaward bays. Much of the charm of our old
English scenery, which is fast disappearing elsewhere
before the railway and the canal, is still to be met with
in this sequestered island. Here are uncultivated rocky
slopes, proffering rare wild-flowers; ivy-mantled cliffs and
moss-grown brambles; bays which in winter witness the
howling storm, and sometimes the fearful wreck, but in
summer are invested with the calm beauty of a moonlit
lake. The inhabitants also, many of them “aborigines,”
have a primitive, unsophisticated character in the inland
villages; while, on the coast, this is chequered by that
roving disposition and semi-superstitious bent which are
always to be found among sailors.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the story of a pebble illustrates this
trait of character. Some years ago, I was calling on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
lapidary in Sandown who had done a good deal work
for me, and done it well. His account was settled, and I
was wishing him good morning, when he drew my attention
to a remarkably beautiful pebble, ready cut and polished,
and begged my acceptance of it. Now the stone,
displayed on his board along with other specimens, could
not fail to sell; and was worth <em>to him</em>, I should say,
perhaps a sovereign. I was very unwilling to take it,
but there was no refusing without offending an old
friend; so it went home in my pocket. But somehow
curiosity was stirred in my mind when reflecting on the
circumstance afterwards. Why should he wish to make
me a present? Or, allowing for goodwill taking so
straightforward a course, why part with a stone of so
much moneyed value? A few days after I dropped in
again. My friend was out: but I found his wife, and
stayed for a chat. Presently I referred, quite cursorily,
to the gift which her husband had made me, “and,” said
I, “I wish only it had been something of less value.”
The gentler sex are sometimes more communicative
than their mates. “Ah! sir,” replied Mrs. ⸺, “there
was reason for giving you <em>that</em>, may be. Anyways,
I’m real glad that it’s gone from <em>us</em>.” “Indeed! how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
is that?” “Why, that stone was an unlucky stone for
us, and I wished it to go, somehow.” Then I learned
from her the following singular tale.</p>

<p>Two brothers, sea-faring men, were great friends of
the lapidary and his wife. One day, one of these brothers
found this pebble on the beach, and had it cut. It
turned out, as I have said, a remarkably fine specimen.
It was what they call a “deep-sea” pebble, and the
“choanite” of a reddish hue lay exactly central in the
bonze of white limestone. The sailors were both of them
quite fond of it: and when they went to sea again, the
handsome pebble went with them, and was laid “o’ nights”
on a shelf by the hammock.</p>

<p>Their boat was upset: one brother was drowned: the
other righted the craft and got to shore, not without difficulty.
Several articles were missing, having gone to the
bottom; but the pebble was safe.</p>

<p>The survivor brought it back to the lapidary, and
made him accept of it, being unwilling to retain it himself.
The lapidary took it, and put it aside: but his
better half found it out, and insisted that he should
neither sell it nor keep it. So, he <em>gave it away</em>. This
stone I afterwards parted with to a London collector:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
not wishing to preserve so sad a reminiscence. I took
a fossil in exchange, which I almost immediately lost.
So, nothing connected with the mysterious choanite was
“lucky.”</p>

<p>Perhaps every feature in “Vectis,” from the matted
festoons on its honey-combed rocks to the “witchery of
its soft blue sky,” predisposes a frequent visitor to approve
also of its pebbles. But it is an unprejudiced fact, that
in texture and colour they excel those which are found
on the Sussex beaches. And while I think highly of
our Devonshire jaspers, I remember a jasper-agate,
gathered some years ago at Sandown, which might
challenge all such stones of native growth in our
London museums, and bear away the palm.</p>

<p>Many a calm summer’s evening, many a stormy
winter’s forenoon, have I whiled away in absolute contentment
on that most interesting shore. In the hot
noons of July the bathing is delicious; and after your
bath, the shadow cast by overhanging cliffs, and a fanning
breeze from the sea, make a ramble onwards
irresistible. But I found winter as pleasant in its way.
When the gust roared, and chimneys smoked, and the
heavens looked dark and disturbed, it was inspiriting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
go forth roughly clad, and to watch the fitful changes
where the weather-gleam strikes upon Culver; or to mark
how that treacherous mist would come creeping round
Dunnose, till the “white horses” rose on the sea, and
the heavy squall which had long been packing in the
offing burst with a wild cry, driving in a yet heavier
element with tatters of oar-weed and splinters of broken
dyke against the face of the immovable cliff.</p>

<p>After passing Shanklin, the style of scenery as far as
Luccombe and the Fishers’ huts, is quaint and picturesque.
Here the “Gault” makes its appearance, and the hill-paths
are in consequence slippery and dangerous. After
this, succeed several miles of fairy-like beauty. And then,
the stern grandeur of Black-gang, the coast-line trending
away in a range as savage as that of Calabria. And
last, the chosen home of the poet, sublime Freshwater,
and rainbow-tinted Alum-Bay.</p>

<p class="tb">Having said so much on the pleasure of beach-rambling,
it may be well to put tourists on their guard
in two important particulars. The first of these touches
personal safety. No one should set out upon what may
prove a prolonged expedition without first ascertaining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<em>on Kalendar authority</em>, the hours of the tide for that
day. There are sundry points on the coast of the Isle
of Wight, for instance, where after a couple of hours’
progress, on scientific thoughts intent, the pedestrian
may find himself hemmed in by a jutting precipice in
front, while the advancing tide behind has gradually cut
off all hopes of a retreat on “terra firma:” and as the
face of the cliff is seldom such as admits of being scaled,
it will then fare badly with him if he be not “the king
of fishes.”</p>

<p>The other matter respects fatigue. Hearty exercise is
desirable; not so that which results in utter exhaustion.
My own experience is as follows:—I have climbed to the
summit of Sca’ Fell, and then walked back, footsore and
fasting, to Keswick. I have swum a mile before breakfast.
I have ascended Mount Etna at midnight in
December’s snow. But for sheer fatigue, pulling at the
muscles, and drying up the marrow, there is nothing
equal to ten miles of stiff shingle, while a foggy north-easter
currycombs your face, and perhaps your shoe-leather
has been laid open by the edge of an inauspicious
flint.</p>

<p>If in addition to all this, forgetting “Cording,” you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sallied forth <i lang="la">non bene relictâ parmulâ</i>, your condition is
by no means enviable. Therefore, whoever intends to go
beaching in earnest should look to his outer man, and
carry with him certain creature-comforts, not omitting to
include in these a supply of good tobacco.</p>

<p>Yet one word more upon this head. Have a due
regard to the well-being of your eyes. They are, as you
will not fail to acknowledge, the working party on these
occasions. Manage how you will, they <em>must</em> be subjected
to a great stress and strain. Give them half an hour’s
respite, if possible, while you sit down and inhale the
“weed.” It is unpleasant to find, after too intense a
service on the part of your “daylights,” as you return
homewards along the meadow-path, that a beach you
have left two or three miles behind you is all <em>coming
back</em>, whether you like it or no, upon your organs of
vision.</p>

<p class="tb">On the whole, summer is the most fruitful season for
stocking a cabinet, on account of the more powerful
illumination cast upon the objects of your search. But
in winter the beach itself is very likely to be in better
condition, for it is oftener agitated, and many specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
will come to the surface which in calmer weather lie
buried under sand. It is important to train yourself to
attentive observation, and after long habit the ear will
listen intuitively.</p>

<p>If you hear the sea make a dull, booming noise during
the night, be on the look-out two or three tides later,
when the first shingle now thrown up has sifted and
settled down. Large pebbles will then be found on the
top of all, the process being much like that which takes
place on shaking a basin of lump sugar.</p>

<p>But it will be well for you to be always on the alert.
The seaside elements must be coaxed and humoured, if
you hope to get anything by their agency. A beach
itself is exceedingly capricious. On some days you may
walk for miles and remark nothing worth picking up;
perhaps the next day, over the same ground, so great
will be the profusion of fossils as to suggest the idea
that since your last visit a petrified shoal had returned to
life, swum into the bay, and there been once more stifled
in gurgling lime, or liquid silex, and penetrated by the
metallic “moss.”</p>

<p>“The sea yields its harvests without sowing or planting,”
and seaside scenery is exquisite if you have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
upon it where it is unsophisticated. Happily it is in
such sequestered “Edens of the <em>western</em> wave” that the
most desirable pebbles are met with. I have gathered
rare specimens where the dor-hawk was wheeling overhead,
and saucy sea-gulls screeching almost in my face;
while a cunning crow would watch from a projecting
ledge of rock to see whether I was about to capture, and
afterwards throw away, anything which might serve him
for a luncheon.</p>

<p>The terraces of Margate and Ramsgate are invaluable
to the tired artizans of London seeking their well-earned
recreation; but no poet could venture to affirm of them
what Scott said of “Brignall banks,” that they are “wild
and fair.” But quit these populous thoroughfares, and
get away to pearly Beachey Head, or roam the lone
strands of Yorkshire or Devon, or go and lose yourself
among shadowy nooks and gleaming bays in the sweetest
of all islands, and you will possess the genuine colour
and scent, and music and mystery of the sea, as the
Creator has framed and blended that wondrous element.</p>

<p>You need not look for pebbles unless you like; sometimes
it were better not. But saunter down to the
water’s crinkled edge, and inhale that indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
odour from old rock, slippery now with dulse and ribbon-weed—Piesse
and Lubin distil nothing to equal it—and
con the page in Nature’s volume which lies open before
you; it will never give you a head-ache, nor a heart-ache
either.</p>

<p>Here, after presently stripping to the elbow, you may
surprise a hermit-crab, or catch the spotted “goby” in
his dark saline pool, but please let him go again; you
ought to give him his freedom, if only out of gratitude;
for all this time your own tired body is being braced and
refreshed, and your mind, yesterday jaded and careworn,
is winning back its elasticity under a sense of blessed
repose.</p>

<p>I will now mention some peculiarities in the nature of
our beaches, which I have noted from time to time in
the book of my experience.</p>

<p class="tb">A BEACH is supposed to be a permanent accumulation
of pebbles and small shingle, due to such cliffs or
banks as are near at hand. And this general definition
would be so far scientifically correct, if nature were stagnant
like the surface of a deserted mill-pond. But, as Nature
is always at work, always shifting the scenes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
above definition, although it sounds like a truism, does
not hold good in either of its clauses. The accumulation
which we look upon is <em>not</em> permanent, nor is it always
due to a neighbouring source. Sometimes the collection
of stones which we find heaped up in an immemorial
bay has been washed round—much of it, perchance,
recently—from a distant quarter. And this might be
taking place under our very eyes, and we not know it,
just as we do not <em>see</em> the grass grow. Except in very
calm weather, beaches are continually travelling, and
they travel rapidly along certain lines of coast, until they
arrive at a terminal point or headland. To get round this
latter takes time, but they do get round it at last, with
the help of strong gales prevailing in one direction, and
under the rushing tides of an equinox. Now if we suppose
a few acres of shingle to be once fairly carried past
such a promontory, and discharged into the curve of an
elliptical bay, they will be locked in, and may, perhaps,
never get out again.</p>

<p>I have myself no doubt that Sandown Beach is fed and
replenished in this manner: and the bay being deeply
indented with the points of Culver and Dunnose, prominent
at opposite extremities, egress is difficult. Yet most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
persons might naturally suppose that whatever they find
on the beach here is due to its overhanging cliffs.</p>

<p>Some of the best pebbles travel fast, and are, in fact,
migratory, till they reach such a “nidus” as I have
described. This is owing to the rounded form which
fossils usually assume. Angular lumps rather remain
stationary. Jasper I suppose makes few excursions:
while the agates and oval choanites are continually on
the move, and may have visited a dozen different localities
before they are picked up. I have hunted a bit of
yellow agate in this way for above a mile in the course of
a few weeks, dropping it again on purpose, and never
finding it in the same place.</p>

<p>Beside the above real motion of a beach, there is an
apparent total change for a time which is by no means
uncommon in exposed situations.</p>

<p>This is, when an inshore gale drifts the sand and conceals
for a day or two the entire mass of shingle. It is
a provoking circumstance when it occurs, but it seldom
lasts long in its effects. The sudden re-appearance of
half a mile of solid beach, as if by magic, on a change
of the wind, has sometimes surprised me in spite of past
experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>In average weather, when a beach is not migrating,
the rise and fall of the pebbles in the same lines is very
observable. The only change then induced in a stratum
of shingle is by the suck and draught of the sea. This
latter, however, is unceasing, as may readily be tested
by bathers; everything which you set your foot upon
under the wave being in a gentle rolling motion. It
yields an amusing diversion in the water, to play the
pebbles about under one’s feet. The effect of it, however,
is not so quaint as that which I remember experiencing
many years ago in Loch Long, where are no
pebbles, but plenty of mud. Here, wading out in the
shallows to arrive at swimming depth, I put one foot
after the other on the backs of some unsuspecting
flounders lying on the sand, and laughed aloud at the
tickling sensation as they glided away from under me.</p>

<p>But all <em>motion</em> is a source of interest and charm,
especially while we are on the sunny side of forty. I
believe that this forms one feature of delight in the capture
of winged insects. Exquisite as is a good British
collection, the dry side of the science, whatever learned
entomologists may say, is not the most inviting, and
would attract comparatively few persons after a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>In like manner, who would care for cover-shooting, if
all were sitting-shots? But the “runners” and “fliers”
impart a zest.</p>

<p>Even here, my friends the seaside pebbles have a claim
to please: for, although inanimate, they are not altogether
devoid of motion, as I think I have shown.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>CONCERNING CERTAIN PETRIFIED ZOOPHYTES, NOW
GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE EXTINCT.</p>

</div>

<p>The petrifaction of an animal form or structure has
always appeared to me a most singular process in Nature.
The change of such substances as cellular tissue, or fish-bone,
or cartilage, or a light, leathery skin, into minerals
such as silex and agate, seems at first like magic. Scott,
when describing the “foliaged tracery” in the east oriel
of Melrose Abbey, tells his reader:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Thou wouldst have thought some fairy’s hand</div>
<div class="verse">’Twixt poplars straight the osier wand</div>
<div class="verse">In many a freakish knot had twined,</div>
<div class="verse">Then framed a spell when the work was done,</div>
<div class="verse">And changed the willow wreaths to stone.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there is no magic in Nature; and when we meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with undoubted phenomena, however strange they may
appear, in any department of her realm, we must behave
ourselves like matter-of-fact persons and set about accounting
for them logically. In a genuine petrifaction
there are two ways of doing this, or, in other words, there
are two different modes in which Nature may have acted
so as to produce the result which we are considering. One
of these is that of a simple <em>substitution</em>; the particles
of one substance being gradually removed, and those of
another taking their place. This must have been the
process which obtained in many well-known instances:
as, for example, when the thin, leathery shell or husk of
an echinus is found perfectly rendered, both as to its
general outline and minute markings, in solid flint or
limestone. We feel quite sure that the original husk has
perished; but here is its second self.</p>

<p>The other mode is that of actual <em>transmutation</em>,
wherein no part of the original substance is destroyed
or removed, but its physical conditions undergo a total
change, by means of either infiltration, or crystallization,
or perhaps both of them combined. This process has
obtained in such cases as a petrified shark’s tooth, or a
fossil trilobite from the Wenlock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The tooth, which was once bone, is now a kind of
metallic stone: the trilobite once, as we suppose, shell
and cartilage, is now a something between limestone and
cast-iron. And this change is very wonderful; but, as
was said above, there is no magic in it, no more than in
the hardening of an infant’s skull, or the solidifying of
the arm and leg-bones by the absorption of phosphate of
lime. Besides, the stone and metal now present are still
something different from what we ordinarily mean by
those terms: the petrified tooth is not like a flint-stone,
neither could you cut horse-shoe nails out of the trilobite.</p>

<p>In fact, every <em>real</em> process has a character of its own:
a something which distinguishes it from any other,
despite of general resemblances up to a certain point.</p>

<p>Petrifaction, then, being assumed, as an operation
which has really taken place after one way or another,
it falls next to be considered, what was the original
nature of these fossils? I mean the objects which we
find thus preserved in our seaside pebbles. What was
the department in Creation to which they belonged?
Was it <em>animal</em> or <em>vegetable</em> before it thus became altogether
<em>mineral</em>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>For myself, I will at once say that I have no doubt it
was animal; but not an animal of a very high order.
The specimens which I now possess, and which are all of
them chosen, some of them <em>rare</em>, I should assign to
such creatures as the “zoophytes” or “polyps,” both radiated
and globular. And I know of nothing, among
many hundreds of specimens gathered from a dozen
different beaches, which presents the evidence of having
belonged to vegetable organization, with the exception of
sundry varieties of petrified wood, which speak for themselves,
and could not be mistaken by anybody.</p>

<p>I will now state two or three reasons, which to my own
mind are conclusive, for the above decision.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, the structures here perpetuated
in stone are of great delicacy, and they have been immersed
in ancient seas, as is testified by the localities in
which they are obtained. Now vegetable structure as
fine as this, if immersed long enough for any such
change to come in question, must have utterly perished
by maceration, and then the petrifaction could not have
taken place. I know that part of the stem (and I think
fruit) of one species of “conifer” has been found in the
Isle of Wight in the condition of a fossil; but this belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to a hardy class of plants, and the lobes or plates
which composed its bark and husk are themselves highly
siliceous, to say nothing of the presence of iron in the
rind of most of these stems. So that the process would
be a long one, and the fibrous material of the tree would
stand it well. But in these pebbles some of the threads
or tubes run from the size of small twine to that of
the rays in a spider’s web; and no vegetable substance
with which I am acquainted, excepting the filaments of
“asbestos” (which is a vegetating <em>mineral</em>) in rock-crystal,
could abide and retain its form, so as to allow
of the changes by infiltration or otherwise which have
passed upon the original structure.</p>

<p>If it be said in reply to this, that we have the exquisitely
delicate “dendritic” markings, as of leaves and
filaments of shrubs or sea-weed, in the heart of the
white chalcedony “mocha-stones” from the East, the
answer is evident: these are not <em>really</em> vegetable traces,
but only <em>resemble</em> such in their configuration and colours.
They are simply shoots and ramifications of a metal,—as
iron or manganese. Those in the “weed-agate” of India,
which exactly resemble sprays of fine sea-weed, are produced
by “delessite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, it is both diverting and instructive to observe
how Nature permits, and even seems to abound in, curious
coincidences and striking resemblances between
things of entirely diverse character. The dried polyp,
called “encrinoid echinoderm,” bears a wonderful likeness
to one species of Indian corn. (See the plate at
p. 137 of Mr. Rymer Jones’s beautiful work on “The
Animal Kingdom.”) And the other day, when I was
enjoying a leisure hour in the British Museum, I suddenly
remarked that the “carapace” (back-shell) of the
splendid fossil specimen of the “Holoptychius nobilissimus”
in one of the cases might serve for a sketch
of the back of a <em>capercailzie</em>, where the grey and purple
feathers overlap one another. Yet here is no <em>real</em> connection
whatever. Only Dame Nature had gone to play.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The preservation of these “polyp” forms,
in the manner in which they <em>have</em> been preserved, seems
to me to be due to a feature or circumstance which is
strictly animal and not vegetable. I refer to the fact
of the creature, while it was alive, <em>inhabiting a house</em>,
a house built by himself, or emanating from his own
substance. For, just as we could know but little of the
existence or habits of “shell-fish,” were it not for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<em>shells</em>, so I think we may assume that the <em>choanite</em>
must, when alive, have dwelt in a tough, horny “coperculum,”
answering to the shape of his body and
the number of his “polyps” (if he was a <em>compound</em>
creature), because otherwise he would have been like a
jelly-fish or naked slug, and his “polypary” could not
have been preserved in a stony fossil. Of course, whatever
was merely flesh, or adipose matter, has long since
perished; but the <em>house</em> or shell in which it whilome
dwelt remains. Thus, the “echinus” built himself a
<em>dome</em>, such a residence as a <em>hedgehog</em> would require to
live comfortably in, and through the various orifices of
which his spines could be protruded at pleasure. The
“ammonite,” being shaped like a <em>snake</em>, preferred living
in a shell of that form, where the creature when coiled
up was safe. The “alcyonite” had a more exquisite taste
in house-building, answering, we may be sure, to the
complex and beautiful structure with which the great
Creator had endowed him. His home was a palace,
containing long galleries and secret doors and wheel-windows;
and here some of the delicate tubes are fringed
at their extremities like the petals of a flower.</p>

<p>The antiquity of these formations may be very great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
we can scarcely tell how far removed from our own era.
For, while the zoophyte itself is of a perishable nature,
we are acquainted with no substance more durable (if we
except the gems) than that calcareous matter of which
these tubes and plates were formed, when once it has
been subjected to processes of infiltration by crystallizing
mineral and metallic oxides.</p>

<p>Now, I think this argument a very strong one; in
fact, although simple, almost unanswerable. For no
<em>plant</em> dwells thus in a house. We have the plant
itself, but nothing more; and if this be not capable, and
I hold it to be incapable, of sustaining the most vehement
mineralizing process in the crucible of Nature, its
history must be a brief one, and excepting in the dark
“lithographs” of the coal-measures, its memory must
pass away. I have already allowed an exceptionable
case in favour of the <em>conifers</em>, which, be it observed,
nowise resemble anything portrayed in siliceous pebbles,
and it is remarkable how much this class of plants predominates
in the COAL.</p>

<p>I have always been suspicious of what are called
“vegetable petrifactions.” I examined those at Tivoli,
near Rome, in the year 1845, and I made up my mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that they are simple <em>incrustations</em>. In like manner,
many of the buildings at Pæstum are constructed with a
kind of “travertine” taken from the bed of a neighbouring
river, and which rapidly incrusts any solid objects
submitted to the action of its waters. But the
truth is, the vegetable pipe or “straw” remains for a
while, owing to the silex which entered into its composition
while the plant was growing. After some years the
<em>straw</em> decays, and there is a hole or depression in that
part of the pillar or pediment. On the other hand,
a calcareous “menstruum,” imbibing silex and iron,
hardens into a substance which, like the best mortar
or cement used in building, will sometimes outlast
even the blocks of limestone or oolite which it was put
to bind together.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> Animal organization, such even as these
polyps possessed, renders the phenomena much more intelligible.
Our best authorities in such matters tell us
that “<em>insects</em> have neither lungs nor branchiæ; but in
them the air passes into <em>a system of tubes</em>, whose structure
resembles that of an elastic webbing.” And again,
“The <em>annelids</em> possess an <em>uninterrupted circulation</em>.”
And again, “In the ‘Nymphon’ and ‘Pycnogonum’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
molluscs, which are crustaceans having considerable resemblance
to certain of our field spiders, the intestine
<em>penetrates to the very extremities</em> of the feet and claws.”—<cite>Animal
Kingdom.</cite> Now here are cited some of the
very desiderata which I should have named, had I
been asked what conditions were needed <i lang="la">à priori</i> for such
petrifactions to occur. I will only add, under this
head, that a fine <em>annelid</em> occurs in the blue agate off
Eastbourne; that a “myriapod,” which is among the
chromo plates of this volume, has all the characteristics
of <em>insect</em> life and motion; and that a <em>spider</em>
is the nearest thing I know of, in some respects, to what
the “choanite” must have been when that mollusc condensed
himself from a cylinder to a sphere. Perhaps,
however, the strongest clause in this part of the argument
may be drawn from the “sponges.” Here the creature
itself, wonderful to relate, is a <em>viscous fluid</em>, and the intricate
mansion which he inhabits is a globose, horny
skeleton, perforated with endless small tubes opening
into wider galleries. There was, however, in the perfect
animal, I am assured, one main central cavity, which
gave strength and unity to the entire fabric by the plan
of its walls, and, perhaps, by a main valve. Throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the whole of this hydraulic system the sea-water, on the
circulation of which the zoophyte depended for life and
health, could be pumped to and fro at pleasure. And,
evidently, when the “habitat” of such a creature was
suddenly invaded by a siliceous crystalline solution, extinction
of the animal and a petrifying investment of his
abode would be simultaneous.</p>

<p><i>Lastly.</i> If the objects here petrified had been vegetable
in their extraction, should we not, with the aid of
the microscope, be able to identify them? But this I
have never yet succeeded in doing; yet all the petrified
“woods” are well known. I have myself obtained slabs
of the “acacia” from the coast of South Devon; of the
“beech,” in Sussex; of coniferous wood almost everywhere.
And, what is more to the purpose, though the
petrifaction in such cases is deep and perfect, no one
looking upon it could doubt for a moment that the original
structure had been that of wood from a forest-tree.
Agatized as it is, and penetrated here and there by
metallic colours, and shot with rays of jasper, the lines
in its fabric reveal <em>the texture of wood</em>.</p>

<p>I may mention here, that every one who walks our
beaches, with a view to the collection of fossil specimens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
will do well to carry in his or her pocket a good lens, of
large external diameter; mine measures about two inches
across, and I may truly say it has saved me a world of
trouble, besides affording me much satisfaction at odd
moments in the scrutiny of pebbles of different kinds and
textures.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter I may be permitted to draw
the reader’s attention to a theory held by the late Dr.
Mantell. I cannot, at this moment, lay my hand upon
the volume in which it occurs, but I am pretty sure it
will be found in his “Geology of the Isle of Wight:” a
book which, for elegance of composition, and sound information,
can hardly be too much commended; though a
resident lapidary in Sandown <em>did</em> once say to me, while
thumbing the pages of a well-worn copy, “Ah, sir! if
the Doctor had come <em>here</em> and stayed a week instead of
listening only to what those fellows told him in Ryde, I
could have shown him something which he doesn’t seem
to know, as to how the bit of coast runs hereabouts.”
Dr. Mantell’s idea was this: he held that when a mollusc
was subjected to the first stage in the petrifying process,
there was, in the dying of the creature, some effusion of
blood (or <i lang="la">quasi</i>-blood), and that this, being the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
pith and strength of the animal’s system, would, in many
cases, tinge the future stone indelibly. He carried this
notion so far as to assign some dark blotches, apparent
in the masonry of a wall, to such a source as being their
most probable cause; and he gave to the thing itself the
graphic title of <em>Molluskite</em>. In this view I will only add
that I am inclined to agree with him; and in my “myriapod,”
already referred to, there is a blood-red spot which
pierces through the stone, appearing on both sides, and
which I at first supposed to be a piece of “shell-lac,”
but I now rather regard it as the trace left of himself
by some marauding “pholas,” who, after drilling a hole
through the solid pebble, found his own grave there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>ON THE LITORAL LABOURS OF THE OCEAN, AND ON
SEASIDE SPORTS.</p>

</div>

<p>The more I consider the various phenomena occurring
from time to time on the dry land, and the more opportunity
I have of observing for myself simple facts in
geology, the more I am struck at once with the truthfulness
and the <em>unexpectedness</em>—if I may use such a word—of
the assertion which Moses makes in the 1st chapter
of Genesis, that the appearance of the “dry land” was
due to “the gathering together of the waters unto one
place.”</p>

<p>The assertion has an unexpected (<i lang="la">à priori</i>) character;
for continents and tracts of dry land do not, on the face
of them, suggest the idea of any recent presence of incumbent
masses of salt water—perhaps miles in depth.
But it is eminently truthful, for it is a key to many an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
abstruse problem in Nature, and a confirmation of every
sound and enlarged view of the past history of this globe.</p>

<p>The ocean has been busily at work—in old times,
inland; in later times, coastwise; in all times subterraneously.
This last point is proved by the volcanoes, and
that in a twofold argument. Such volcanoes as are now
extinct, are so because they have lost all communication
with the sea; such of them as are active, are so because
they draw supplies of salt-water from the nearest part of
the ocean, and this they can only do subterraneously.</p>

<p>But in speaking of the labours of the ocean, I shall
confine myself to the seashore, as the scope of this little
volume does not go beyond that region. The point
where sea and land meet is the critical point for all
observers of Nature. Here the disciple of geology
should serve his apprenticeship, and if he cannot accumulate
facts, and glean a kind of inspiration here, he
cannot do so anywhere. Moreover here, better, we think,
than in any inland scenery, Man can muse and meditate.
That ever-varying curved line of moisture on the shore
depicts the fluctuating changes which momentarily visit
his “little day;” the tide running in is the flood of his
early life; the tide running out is the ebb of his declining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
years; the vast sweep of the coast, backed by the upland
ranges and everlasting hills, and itself only lost to sight
in the far horizon, tells of a steadfast future, an immutable
eternity.</p>

<p>Above all, those who desire to note epochs in the
flight of Time, and to set up way-marks in the Earth’s
chronology, must study the line of the sea-coast, the
ancient and the modern, for here, if anywhere, the dial-plate
is uncovered, and the shadow of the gnomon may
be traced through some seconds of the enormous day
which has witnessed the existence of the heavens and
the earth.</p>

<p>I have already, in my opening chapter, remarked how
the sea brings down, in the course of ages, many a
pebbly beach from cliff and causeway. But I am far
from assuming, therefore, that <em>all</em> the pebbles of a beach
come from the land. The usual bottom of the sea is,
indeed, no pebbly shore; but there are many submerged
rocks of sandstone and oolite, out of whose ribs and
crevices, from time to time, fossils may be washed, just
as our own chalk-cliffs, the main resort of the siliceous
pebbles, were themselves laid down in deep seas. And
the salt water, which is always acting gradually to dissolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
certain rocks, when it removes portions of these from the
edges and promontories, will occasionally bring their
contents to shore. But these results, although interesting
to those who maybe searching after pebbles (and a deep-sea
pebble is a prize), were not what I pointed at when I
spoke of the labours of the ocean.</p>

<p>I have frequently walked the shore, and observed the
colour of the waves, after what is termed a “ground
swell,” which had lasted, perhaps, for thirty or forty
hours. The cerulean hue is then gone, and to it has
succeeded, in certain localities, an opaque chalky tinge,
showing that the water is now heavily charged with lime.
Also fragments of shells rolled together are united with
heavy masses of sand, and sometimes of broken pumice-stone,
and a kind of rough marl is rapidly formed,
and left on the beach. After a gale, and succeeding
“swell,” I have met with these imperfect boulders, varying
in size from that of a man’s fist to some larger than
his head. At the same time, any low ranges of littoral
rocks become crusted over with the superabundant lime,
being more than the waves will long hold in solution;
and a coating is thus given to such rocks which is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as hard as is the native limestone itself, a few weeks’
exposure to the sun and air sufficing to effect this.</p>

<p>Some fourteen years ago, I had an opportunity, when
in Sicily, of examining a portion of the coast between
Messina and Catania, and I regret that I did not avail
myself of it more heartily. But I have seen M. Quatrefage’s
book on this subject, and his observations, most
carefully and laboriously conducted, may almost be said
to close that part of the subject, as far as any prospect
of eliciting fresh information is concerned. I think he
measured some of the long reefs, and the evident increase
<em>by incrustation</em> extended for many miles of the coast-line,
and was of considerable thickness. I have observed
the same “masonic” phenomenon off the coast of St.
Andrews, in Fifeshire, when swimming out among the
weedy rocks, and afterwards climbing to the shore. I
then thought it was the work of marine insects, as I had
heard of molluscs building causeways of tubes of limestone,
but I incline now to think it was the sea doing
it, as they say, at <em>first-hand</em>. The sea, however, does a
great deal in the same line at second-hand, by means,
chiefly, of two species of zoanthoid polyps. Of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
little creatures, one kind constructs the bases of coral
islands, and another the summits (at the least) of the
madrepore reefs. It is impossible to doubt that by
labours so patiently carried on, and so widely diffused,
some beneficent purpose is aimed at and attained by
Providence. Perhaps they operate, finally, to warn the
shipping of adventurous merchants from entering certain
dangerous bays and straits; and if the humble madrepore
has got a bad name through this, as though he had
made the danger, he certainly suffers unjustly, for what
real difference, as to ultimate and assured safety, can a
few inches more of water in such places make? Far
better to raise an impassable bar across the way at once,
and proclaim, “no thoroughfare!”</p>

<p>Then the ocean supplies a great market, much the
greatest in the world. I do not know the proportion of
persons in Central Europe who live on fish to those who
live on meat, but I think, in both Northern and Southern
Europe, the former exceed the latter. In Connemara, on
the western coast of Ireland, and in the Scotch highlands
of Argyle and Inverness, fish is decidedly the
staple article of diet, as far as animal food is concerned.
I believe the same is true of Cornwall and part of Devon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The herring, the pilchard, the haddock, the cod, and the
salmon—to say nothing of the sole and other flat-fish—feed
millions of persons, and, with the help of
oatmeal, barley-cakes, and (in a good year) potatoes,
feed them well. Shell-fish are also no mean item, and
are sometimes the most refreshing of all dishes, especially
at the supper-table. Now the sea, it must be remembered,
does all this for man without harrowing, ploughing, or
sowing. The fisherman’s net may be said to <em>reap</em>, that
is all.</p>

<p>Again, if jewels be of any real value, what is the value
(among such) of a collar of faultless pearls? what is
there among minerals, so pure, so exquisitely beautiful,
whether we regard their tint or their form? These are the
spontaneous production of a humble shell-fish; some
say, an offering from the creature when he has been
wounded. If so, men may here learn a lesson in kind,
and return good for evil to those who persecute them.</p>

<p>Again, the ocean is <em>our</em> defence: long may it prove so!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Britannia needs no bulwark,</div>
<div class="verse">No towers along the steep,</div>
<div class="verse">Her march is o’er the mountain wave,</div>
<div class="verse">Her home is on the deep.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No doubt, since man is a creature who <em>lives</em> upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
dry land, the land is on the whole the most valuable; but
what would the land be without the sea? Nay, to go no
further, how could we exist in summer and autumn, if
deprived of the sea-breezes? For myself, though naturally
fond of field-sports, and delighting in botanical and
entomological pursuits, I know of no treat equal to that
of a seaside ramble in the month, say, of September or
October.</p>

<p>Now let us consider how very little mischief the ocean
does us. Much fewer people die of what are called
“casualties” by sea, than of those by land. The truth is,
we always hear of such as are lost at sea, because of the
loss of <em>the ship</em>, which involves a question of insurance-money;
but of deaths inland, especially in far countries,
and if belonging to strange peoples or savage tribes, we
perchance scarce hear at all. YEH, the Chinese Commissioner,
killed, it was said, 70,000 persons in the course
of his brief career, for <em>political</em> reasons. How long
would it take for 70,000 persons to perish by storms
or accidents at sea, in the usual course of things, in one
small part of the globe?</p>

<p>A wreck, it must be allowed, is a terrible thing; but
so is a house on fire, or a flood up the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The sea, moreover, labours to help the land in other
ways, some of them singular enough. Many thousands
of poor unproductive acres have, in these last ten years,
been rendered rich and fertile by supplies of GUANO.
And whence did we get the guano? why, from the <em>sea-fowl</em>,
and from a barren rock in the bosom of the seas!
This is no trifling benefit to reap from the “desert sea.”</p>

<p>What a beautiful thing is <em>glass</em>, and how indispensable
it has become to us! Perhaps no other material can be
insured to be <em>perfectly</em> clean and pure for drinking out
of. For many years our glass-works depended mainly
upon a constant supply of <em>kelp</em> from the Orkneys, and
even now they cannot dispense with the sea-sand.</p>

<p>The porcelain mills in Staffordshire and elsewhere
are very glad to obtain a cartload of pebbles from the
beach. These go to the “crushing” department; and if
among them there are, as there are pretty sure to be,
a dozen lumps of chalcedony, the material of the next
batch of teacups will be unusually fine, provided some
one who understands them <em>picks</em> the stones first. Indeed,
if I had no preferable occupation in this world, I have
often thought I would collect the rough agates and chalcedonies
from sundry localities I wot of, and fabricate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<em>biscuit</em> of my own, as the king of Saxony does at
Meissen. But though I have not the leisure for this,
others may have; and so I mention it here.</p>

<p>Especially I incline to think that a splendid kind of
“Wedgewood” ware would result from the crushing of
certain jaspers, for I suppose their colours would not
fade in the furnace.</p>

<p>Then, the seaside visit, I must not omit to mention,
can be enlivened by sundry local pursuits and amusements.
Besides the pleasures of a sailing-boat, and a
run with the “dredge” and the “dipping-net,” there is
the exciting march of the Shrimper, knee-deep in the
wave, pushing the hoop-net before him, and every now
and then halting to fill his front pocket with the silvery
jumpers. If there are rocks near at hand, there will be
<em>lobster-pots</em> to visit; and the habits and deportment of a
live lobster are among the most curious in creation. In
agility and cunning he surpasses even a salmon. Also,
for the benefit of those who at all regard what they eat—and
he who disregards it is a goose—I may just venture
to hint that a <em>real</em> lobster-salad (London confectioners
have a way of selling <em>sham</em> ones,) is a dish worthy their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
serious attention: Barclay’s stout being not a bad accompaniment.</p>

<p>But the above will sound to some persons too “Epicurean.”
O gentle reader, do you love moonlight? and if
you have ever admired the reflection of that planet in a
lake or river, what will you say to it when you contemplate
it in Sandown Bay? Culver on one side, looking as
if it were of green glass, and the cliffs of Shanklin on the
other resembling walls and pillars of porphyry! Or is
your taste for the sterner beauty of storms and angry seas?
Then visit Blackgang Chine late in winter, and you may
“sup full of horrors.” The appearance of the waves below,
as they come in over that fatal “race,” and the aspect of
the earth and the heavens above, when the lightning
darts from “St. Catherine’s head” and sweeps like a
destroying Angel down the chasm of the Chine, yield together
perhaps the grandest picture of desolation and
terror that English scenery ever shows.</p>

<p>There are persons still living who are unwilling <em>to speak</em>
of the fearful tempest they witnessed on that coast when
the Clarendon was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, to return to our “pebbles,” the sea is an
indefatigable agent in the partly mechanical, partly
chemical, work of infiltration; a process to which both
the fine texture and varied colours of these agatized
fossils are mainly due.</p>

<p>But of this I must treat in the chapter which follows.</p>

<p>Enough, for the present, of the ocean itself—of its
labours and its sports. But, as some readers love <em>a
comparison</em>, and hold that every theme grows dull without
this, I will quote from the lips of a great traveller,
whom it was once my luck to meet, his opinion of the
rival claims of the Desert, to that admiration which we
islanders lavish on the heaving Ocean and the winding
Shore. I cannot pretend to remember his very words;
but he was eloquent as the son of Laertes, and he made
me long to visit the East. He said that the Desert was
“another world,” more marvellous than this of our land
and sea: it was a home and a domain, like the former;
yet was it waste and boundless as the latter. I asked
about the <em>sands</em>. “Vast, beyond computation.” “And
the material?” “Powdered quartz, all of it. Quartz
mountains, crushed, and pulverized, and sifted!” The
reddish hue is from the peroxide of iron. No particle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of anything like organized matter has ever been
detected in its composition. The caravan-camels which
drop and die daily on their hot march, as they have
done for centuries, leave their skeletons, after the vulture’s
inquest is over, to bleach upon the surface; and,
in the course of a season or two, these bones must turn
to an impalpable powder: but that does not mix with
the sand, or phosphate of lime would at once be found
on analyzing it.</p>

<p>Then he spoke of the sunrise, and the glowing sunset;
and of the delicious hours of night; and of tent-life
in the Desert; and of wandering Arabs, who revere
the grave and silent man; and of the charms of an
encampment in some green “oasis;” and then, strongest
commendation of all, he said, “I am going back, among
the children of the Desert!”</p>

</div>

<p>The charm which wins and rivets our attention in such
pursuits as those of Geology or Mineralogy, is not
that the phenomena which we meet with are capable
of being classified, and of forming a scientific system.
All this is, no doubt, one day instructive and interesting;
but it was an afterthought, the result of experiment.
The first charm lay in that silent mystery which broods
over every part of creation, a veil as yet unpenetrated by
Science: it lay in our instinctive consciousness that
Nature, in what are, perhaps, her simplest movements,
still transcends all the master-pieces of Art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Take, for instance, the crystalline gems. These are
the most remarkable substances with which we are acquainted;
they are also among the most simple. Chemically
speaking, the metals and gases may claim to be
regarded as simpler bodies; but then it must be remembered
that we do not meet with them in nature
thus unmixed. Gases vary, both in volume and character,
every instant; and ordinary metallic ores are
penetrated and disguised by foreign matter; whereas
faultless crystals, once perfected, appear to be unalterable.</p>

<p>Some of these, as the DIAMOND, would almost seem
to be an elementary substance; and yet this can hardly
be the actual case. The philosophical account of a crystal,
as “some substance, all the particles of which, being
free to move, have been operated upon in the way of a
chemical, perhaps an electrical change,” certainly makes
against it; for, according to this definition, such “substance”
is a first desideratum, without which we cannot
have the “crystal.” Thus, oxygen and hydrogen, blended
together in certain definite proportions, yield the fluid
substance, WATER; and the “crystal” of water is
ICE. In like manner, common white carbonate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
lime, and the fluor spars, whose ingredients we know,
are in daily process of formation.</p>

<p>The philosophical idea, so accurately expressed in the
above definition, is, doubtless, correct, if once we assume
a past history for some substance, and take the crystal
before us as its result. But, whether all bodies which
we now meet with under the form of crystals <em>have, in
point of fact, had such a history</em>, is quite another
question.</p>

<p>The diamond is universally held to be pure CARBON
crystallized. Its high refraction indicated this to Newton
long ago; and the proof has since been given twofold:
for the diamond scales off and evaporates under
intense heat, and its dust has <em>carbonized</em> iron-filings,
turning them into steel.</p>

<p>Further, this carbon is supposed to be of vegetable
origin; and, if so, it would seem to follow that there
must have been plants, and perhaps coal-strata, before
there could be any diamonds.</p>

<p>But <em>what was the process</em> actually carried out in
nature? No one has hitherto succeeded in obtaining
this gem, answering to the conditions of a “brilliant”
in water, lustre, and weight, by any attempted method,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
from the base of carbon. The French chemists have
now, for some years past, been experimenting upon
<em>boron</em>, by means of the voltaic battery; and they have,
it seems, taken out of the crucible sundry small, pale
crystals, which are found to be nearly as hard as
adamantine spar (a variety of <em>corundum</em>); but they
cannot show, as the fruit of their labours, a diamond
weighing one carat, and worth, according to the tariff,
eight pounds sterling in the market of Europe. Indeed,
if this boron be a mineral intermediate between
carbon and silex, their gems will assuredly partake of
the character of rock-crystal, a stone which has no
affinity with the diamond whatever.</p>

<p>The process of Nature, therefore, being unknown, if
indeed it ever took place, the question fairly arises—whether
diamond be a derived crystal, or itself an original
type of created matter. Or it might be put thus:
“If diamond be the purest form of carbon known, what
is carbon then but diamond debased?”</p>

<p>Neither does this exhaust the argument. The ruby
owns a matrix: the pearl grows in the mother-of-pearl.
What is the nature of the diamond-rock? Is it a dark
conglomerate? or is it diaphanous?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>We know how diamonds are obtained: how they are
picked out of the crevices of certain rocks, and washed
out of the sands of certain rivers—in the Carnatic,
and Brazil, and Borneo; but we do not seem to be much
nearer to the history of their parentage.</p>

<p>Again, <em>what is</em> their “crust” or coating with which
they are always found enveloped? Is it an integral part
of the stone, or is it adventitious? In the best diamonds
this crust is of a greenish hue.</p>

<p>Some say that while the gem itself has <em>positive</em> electricity,
its crust shows <em>negative</em>. If this be so, the last
question is answered—the crust in that case cannot be
an integral part of the stone. The only absolute reason
I know of for concluding the diamond to be a <em>derived</em>
substance is, that it is laminar. The Eastern lapidaries,
as it is well known, will sometimes <em>divide</em> a stone
by striking it a sharp blow in the cleavage.</p>

<p>After all, the most extraordinary property of the diamond,
as pure carbon, is its weight. It is fifty times the
weight of refined charcoal. How was the element of
carbon condensed and inspissated thus? Was it by the
action of LIGHT? This is the vegetable analogy; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
we see in the case of all growing plants: did it hold
here?</p>

<p class="tb">If we were to inquire how oriental sapphires, including
the ruby, the blue sapphire, the emerald, and the amethyst,
are formed from CLAY, that clay which exists
in the granite rocks, the difficulty would be nearly as
great. We do not know at all.</p>

<p>But there is some satisfaction in having undoubted
proof of the nature of their “base.” And the obvious
evidence upon this point is very simple, and prior to that
of chemical analysis. My own attention was first drawn
to it many years ago, in a casual remark made by a
friend. We were handling some crystals of the <em>white</em>
sapphire, a stone of little value. “These look very like
glass,” said I. “Yes, but you may always tell them
from glass by their <em>coldness</em>. Touch one with your
tongue.” Then followed the inquiry. “And why is it so
much colder than glass is?” “Because the ‘base’ of the
sapphire is CLAY, and clay is a very cold substance.”</p>

<p class="tb">Let us now pass on to consider the question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
COLOUR. In the existing varieties of gems, we have
all the colours of the <em>spectrum</em> perpetuated and vivid.</p>

<p>What is the source of these colours? And how are
they blended with the solid crystal?</p>

<p>There seems to be no reason for doubting that the
immediate source or cause of colour is the presence of
some oxidized metal. All the colours which Nature has
impressed appear, as far as we can trace them, to be due
to such a presence. Opaline tints, and those of the
“cat’s eye,” are an exception; being the perceptible result
of a peculiar texture and configuration; so also are the
iridescent hues on a <em>soap-bubble</em>, which are probably
caused by polarized light. But it is <em>a metal</em> which
makes the bark of certain trees and shrubs to glisten;
aided, in the case of the birch and wheat-stubble, by
particles of silex. It is a metal, absorbed from juices
of the soil, which gives their tints to flowers, and their
deep tinge to fruits. It is a metal which dyes the plumes
of the king-fisher; and the gleaming scales of the
dragon-fly and diamond-beetle owe their brilliancy to
metallic lustre. Why should this all-pervading law vary
in the crystals?</p>

<p>We know that metals proper affect crystalline forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
assuming them spontaneously; and we know that the
gems have come in contact with metals. <em>Iron</em>, whose
rust is of a reddish hue, enters into many of them;
and in the <em>red</em> stones it is said to be abundant.</p>

<p>Probably, the finer permanent tints are due to <em>gold</em>,
in infinitesimal proportions. Professor Faraday has said
that the ruby-tinted glass called “Bohemian” derives
its colour from gold in a pure form, finely attenuated,
and not from any chemical combination of that substance.</p>

<p>A white diamond has far more lustre than one which
is yellow or violet-tinted. But in all the sapphires, the
deeper the hue, the more brilliant and valuable the stone.
Hence the technical term for the colour of a diamond is
its <em>water</em>. In all these gems the hues (whatever their
origin) are homogeneously united with the crystal; and
the <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> of Nature is a profound secret.</p>

<p class="tb">When we descend in the mineralogical scale, and come
to such stones as agates and jaspers, the process which
has been followed seems quite capable of being traced—for
its antiquity is not so great. The colours which we
now find in pebbles more or less opaque, though occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
lively, exist under very different conditions from
those by which they reside in the crystalline gems. It is
necessary, however, to consider first, the origin and
nature of <em>pebbles</em> as distinguished from casual fragments
of stone.</p>

<p>This was long held to be one of Nature’s riddles; but
as soon as it was experimentally dealt with, it met with a
solution in some of its most difficult points.</p>

<p>It was early decided that pebbles are <em>distinct formations</em>,
complete in themselves, except in so far as they
have been worn away by gradual attrition. The first difficulty
was, how to account for the great hardness of
many of our seaside specimens. Although for the most
part inclosing an “organism,” which must have been
that of some zoophyte, they show no traces, in their present
compact texture, of the soft and yielding consistency
they must at that time have possessed. The matrix in
which they lie, and from which they drop as the ripe nuts
fall from a hazel-bush, is seldom or never of so hard a
substance as are the pebbles themselves; in many cases
the difference is as great as between the teeth and gums
of a living mammal.</p>

<p>But the evidence of the inclosed organism is conclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as to a past history; and in all mixed pebbles—and
ninety-nine out of a hundred of ours are mixed—it is
quite certain that an <em>impregnation</em>, or an actual <em>infiltration</em>,
has taken place.</p>

<p>Either a fluid menstruum, usually siliceous, must have
enveloped and saturated the animal form, or there was
actual injection of chalcedony and limestone, in a soft
state, into the tubes and cells of the skeleton first, and
afterwards into the pores and crevices of the new stone.
Frequently both processes have obtained. The only alternative,
viz. that which suggests that composite pebbles,
revealing in their structure distinct traces of animal or
vegetable organization, <em>may have been</em> formed thus at
first, like the coloured prints in a book, I consider to be
untenable. One might as readily credit a spontaneous
growth of almond-cakes or oyster-patties by some sudden
spasmodic effort of our present sea and land.</p>

<p>Impregnation has, no doubt, been always going on.</p>

<p>A French <i lang="fr">savant</i>, M. Reaumur, above a century ago,
wrote as follows:—“By a coarse operation emery is reduced
to powder and suspended in water for several days;
but nature may go much further than this, for the particles
which water detaches from hard stones, by simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
attrition, are of an almost inconceivable degree of fineness.
Water thus impregnated contributes to the formation
of pebbles by petrifying the stone, as it were, a
second time. Stones already formed, but having as yet
a spongy texture, acquire a flinty hardness by impregnation
with this crystalline fluid.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>From such a source, as he supposes, has arisen the
close texture of Egyptian pebbles, coloured jaspers, and
even agates. If he means to include the <em>homogeneous</em>
agates, which are alike free from sparry crystals, metallic
scum, and all traces of organized matter, I do not agree
with him. But in the case of <em>mixed</em> chalcedonic pebbles,
among which may be classed our pretty Isle of Wight
specimens, no doubt such impregnation took place, and
was followed by a further process of infiltration. For
when the flint-nodules, <em>impregnated</em> as above, were still
soft—soft enough we know they were to take delicate impressions
of the spines of the echinus—chalcedony, in a
semi-fluid or viscous state, would pass through the pores
of the flint, because the former is the finer substance of
the two. And after such infiltration, the entire lump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
would harden, resisting, for the most part, further change.
And this would be the pebble as we now find it.</p>

<p>In the “Geological Museum,” now open in Jermyn
Street, there is a case (on the first floor) where the
nature of infiltration is well shown in some jasper-agates.
It will readily be seen here that each internal layer has
been formed in succession <em>from without</em>, the centre of
the pebble filling up last. In another case (labelled
“Silica”), on the opposite side of this room, are some
“choanites” and “sponges” presented by the author.</p>

<p>Those latter will be found worthy of ten minutes’
inspection, even as seen through the plate of glass
which serves to protect them. They are selected, not
as being the finest specimens in his cabinet, but as illustrating,
each of them, a particular animal, or a peculiar
<em>position</em> of one in the fossil state. They are, however,
very good specimens, much above the average; and if
any one became missing, it could never be exactly replaced,
though you should search the world over. Nature
does not stamp the same “medal” <em>twice</em>. Any person
who, after examining these, likes to start a theory of his
own to account for their forms and colours, has my full
permission to do so. But one word I would say in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
friendly warning, seeing that theories do abound. The
Chinese, that ancient and wise people, have a theory that
“asbestos” cloth may have been manufactured “of the
hair of certain rats that lived in the flames of certain
volcanoes.” It were monstrous to doubt it.</p>

<p>In my beach-rambles I have often picked up and examined
globes of sandstone which were partially chalcedonized,
and that by evident infiltration. The lapidaries
call these “sand-agates,” and reject them as unfit
for the wheel; and so they are at present, but it would
be instructive to meet with some of them twenty years
hence, after they had undergone a more confirmed treatment
at the hands of Dame Nature.</p>

<p>The well-known specimens of “petrified wood,” common
on our coasts, and occurring in some beautiful
varieties of beech and acacia in the bays of South Devon,
are a further example of infiltration; but the process
here must have been somewhat different.</p>

<p>The presence of metallic particles, what lapidaries
term the “moss,” in many of our agates, argues an impregnating
fluid, thoroughly charged with mineral matter.
In most cases this fluid was a ferruginous stream, such
as may often be seen issuing from some hidden reservoir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and trickling down the face of a cliff of gault or greensand.
This tinges everything that lies in its path with
an indelible red stain; it then oozes on through the
shingle, and reaches the verge of the sand. The nearest
pool becomes saturated between tides, and the suspended
crystals of salt, which are of a penetrating character (as
the state of your beaching-boots will soon inform you),
enter into chemical combination with the metallic rust,
and help to conduct its particles into the heart of many
a limestone pebble.</p>

<p>Dark inland pebbles, on the other hand, will discharge
much of the oxide which they have imbibed, and may be
observed to brighten and improve their complexions
after a few months’ sponging and tossing in the purer
sea-water.</p>

<p>Some of our handsomer pebbles, when cut in two,
reveal blotches of metal, which are glossy after polishing
on the wheel. This metal is occasionally native iron. The
darker varieties of “moss” contain a good deal of manganese,
and some silver.</p>

<p>From what has been said about impregnation, we may
readily conclude that the <em>colours</em> found in our agate-pebbles
have been chemically inwrought, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
symmetrical <em>patterns</em>, over which these colours are disposed,
are not due to a succession of “layers,” as in the
ribbon-jaspers and Scotch pebbles, but must be referred
to the organization of some extinct zoophyte, whose
skeleton is preserved in the existing fossil.</p>

<p>The cause of translucency, or even <em>transparency</em>, in
some pebbles is, no doubt, to be sought in their finer and
more even texture, but especially in the latter quality.
Sir Isaac Newton was of opinion that the opacity of
certain substances is simply a result of their cross-grained
composition. He held that in a transparent body the
particles must be regularly and evenly disposed at equal
intervals, so that a ray of light entering such a substance
would pass steadily on, according to the known laws of
gravity and motion, meeting with no obstruction beyond
that of the homogeneous density of the medium which
it had to traverse. Whereas, in opaque bodies, he supposes
these constituent particles to be unevenly disposed,
and that the ray which enters at the surface is, as it were,
pushed about and thrust aside, and at length lost to
sight.</p>

<p>The purity of spring-water, when undisturbed, illustrates
this beautiful theory of the great philosopher; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
among solid substances, good glass, especially plate-glass
which, after fusing in the furnace, has been carefully run
and settled in the frames. It may also be simply shown
in the act of wetting or steeping certain dry substances.
Thus, stout writing-paper, owing to its cross texture, is
opaque when dry; but if we immerse a sheet of it in oil,
and then hold it up to the light, we find it has become
transparent. For the smooth medium thus imbibed has
entered its pores, and <em>equalized</em> the general texture.</p>

<p>We find also a striking argument for the probable
truth of Newton’s eagle-eyed conclusion in certain minerals
which possess double refraction.</p>

<p>ICELAND SPAR, one of these, is perhaps the most
perfectly transparent solid with which we are acquainted.
Now, Iceland Spar <em>transmits</em> both the rays, as we see in
the twofold image which is presented to us. But TOURMALINE
is opaque, even the red specimens looking
almost black; and we find that Tourmaline <em>absorbs</em> one
of the two rays of polarized light. This singular stone
polarizes a beam of light if it enter in any direction
but that of the longer axis.</p>

<p>No solid with which we are acquainted is absolutely
transparent. And there is no perfect <em>reflector</em> known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The best-polished surface <em>absorbs nearly one-half</em> of
that quantity of light which strikes upon it.</p>

<p>As to our seaside pebbles, the most compact of them
are even <em>visibly</em> porous. Cut through the hardest jasper,
and polish one face till it shines like a steel mirror, and
then hold it so as to reflect the light, you will at once
discern numerous minute specks or flaws on this surface,
as if the point of a needle or graving-tool had been
busily at work upon it. These specks have always been
there. They are <em>air-holes</em>, and in the case of a fossil-pebble
were, some of them, doubtless, connected with the
position which the animal occupied just before he died.
These air-holes must have traversed this hard stone in
every direction, for, cut the pebble how you will, you
meet with them. Others again, incomparably more
numerous, but which can scarcely be discerned without
the aid of a powerful microscope, are the true <em>pores</em>
belonging to this apparently impenetrable substance.</p>

<p>I have found that the action of daylight tells even
upon polished agates after a time. Some of the spots
and markings in the finest stones grow fainter in the
course of many years. Others appear to deepen. This
is, no doubt, a change resulting from the oxygen, contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in a beam of light, acting readily upon carbon,
silex, and other substances. And it furnishes an independent
argument for concluding that the visible
beauty of these formations, in perpetuating a coloured
pattern, has been due rather to mixed <em>chemical</em> processes
than to pure crystallography.</p>

<p>The fossil nodules, mostly siliceous, which we find
upon a sea-beach, are <em>integral</em> specimens. It never but
once happened to me to meet with what appeared to be
<em>two</em> choanites in the same pebble, and I incline now to
believe that this was in fact <em>one</em> choanite who had <em>divided</em>
himself after the manner of the Luidia. But even supposing
that here were, indeed, a pair of perfect animals,
when it is considered that this was one single instance,
occurring among more than a thousand picked up by me,
in which the choanites were always solitary, such an
exception may be almost said to prove the rule.</p>

<p>The late lamented Hugh Miller has stated the like fact
concerning his Morayshire and Cromarty icthyolites.
At pp. 194, 195, of his “Cruise of the Betsy,” he remarks
that “the limestone nodules take very generally
the <em>form</em> of the fish which they inclose; they are
stone coffins carefully moulded to express the outline of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the corpses lying within.” Then, after observing that the
shape of the stone conforms to the attitude of the fish
in every instance, he goes on to state that “the <em>size</em> of
the fish regulates that of the nodule. The coffin is generally
as good a fit in size as in form; and the bulk of the
nodule bears almost always a definite proportion to the
amount of animal round which it had formed.”</p>

<p>He then gives, in his usual clear and graphic language,
the following remarkable statement, the result of direct
experiment.</p>

<p>“When a calcareous earth, mixed up with sand, clay,
and other extraneous matters, was deposited on some of
the commoner molluscs of our shores, it was universally
found that the mass, incoherent everywhere else, had acquired
a solidity wherever it had been penetrated by the
animal matter of the molluscs. Each animal, in proportion
to its size, was found to retain, as in the fossiliferous
spindles of the Old Red Sandstone, its coherent nodule
around it. Here the animal matter gave solidity to the
lime in contact with it. But in the <em>natural</em> phenomenon
of the icthyolite beds, there was yet a further point, for
in these the animal matter must have possessed such <em>an
affinity</em> for the mineral, as to form, in an argillaceous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
compound, a centre of attraction powerful enough to
draw together the lime diffused throughout the mass.”</p>

<p>Hugh Miller concludes the above passage by saying
that “it still remains for the geologic chemist to discover
on what principle masses of animal matter should
form the attracting nuclei of limestone nodules.”</p>

<p>Upon which last remark, I would suggest that the
principle of the “law of definite proportions,” established
by Dalton, and fully borne out by all succeeding
experiments in chemistry, appears to meet the case, geologically
as well as chemically, in every respect. For
such a law must of course obtain, whether the chemical
ingredients be present in the forms of mineral, vegetable,
or animal life; in fact, we have never known the law to
vary. It holds for the compounded elements which we
term AIR and WATER; it holds for the crystals; it
holds for vascular and cellular tissues; why should it fail
when the further instance of a mollusc or a zoophyte is
in question?</p>

<p>I see no reason to doubt that the blood, muscle, membrane,
or adipose matter of any animal have their due
respective affinities for the different substances of the
mineral creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt, however, electricity, as an active cause, bears
directly upon all such phenomena.</p>

<p>I remember many years since being greatly perplexed
with the <em>discovery</em> (as I then thought it) that in certain
parts of the Isle of Wight, and along the Dorsetshire
coast, the rows of dark flints imbedded in the upper chalk
of the cliff-ranges were all <em>broken</em>; broken <em>small</em>, so that
if one were taken out of its chalk socket it crumbled in
your hand. Often and often, I turned this fact over in
my mind, and sought some apparent way to account for
it. But I think I now see one way to account for it;
and which may perhaps be judged worthy of acceptance,
until a better solution is hit upon. In Dr. Hook’s experiment
with that once common household implement,
the “flint and steel,” he found that the <em>sparks</em> which
“fly” upon collision taking place are minute spherules
of metal. And further, that this metal was now not
<em>steel</em> any longer, but iron; the fragments struck off
<em>having lost their polarity</em> in the moment of contact
with the flint.</p>

<p>This experiment shows that silex possesses some remarkable
affinity for the magnetic fluid, since in this
case it had robbed the steel of it, for those spherules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
would not answer to the magnet. May not, therefore,
the rows of flints in the cliff have attracted the lightning
in severe thunderstorms, and been shivered by the blow?
This would not necessarily hurl the chalk down.</p>

<p class="tb">The Arabs have a proverb which says, “Under the
lamp it is dark.” Certainly, the chief mystery of every
animated creature seems to reside <em>in its life</em>, and <em>Life</em> is
like a burning lamp. Once the life extinct, we can anatomize
and analyze, and arrive at many partial conclusions;
but, meanwhile, the life has departed, and we do not know
what that was. The nearest thing to its likeness is
<em>expression</em>; and animals rank high in the scale of being,
according as they command and impart expression. A
dog or horse have a great deal; a bird some; a reptile
or insect, absolutely none to our eyes.</p>

<p>With these latter, however, their <em>habits</em>, while alive, take
the place of any more intelligent expression; especially
some of their more excited movements. We know by the
<em>sound</em>, when a snake is angry; and as to motion, the
attack of a provoked hornet is a startling thing to witness.
Ordinarily speaking, however, all their habits tend
to concealment; no doubt, for the sake of safety. I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
no one ever sees the Sphynx-moth, called a “Death’s-head”
(<i>Acherontia Atropos</i>), on the wing. Yet we discern
many others which, like it, fly in the hours of dusk. But
this insect whirls through the air like a stone from a sling.
It has never yet, in my experience as a naturalist, been my
lot to meet with the burrowing insect called an Ant-lion.
Only twice in my life have I encountered a slow-worm in
the woods of Devon and the Isle of Wight. And to instance
the case of a far commoner creature, how seldom
does it happen to any one to take the large dragon-fly
behind his green leaf!</p>

<p class="tb">And yet the problems of inanimate matter are perhaps
the most difficult to solve. They have deeply exercised
philosophers in every age of the world.</p>

<p>“All things considered,” says Newton, “I think it
probable that God, in the beginning, formed matter in
solid, hard, impenetrable, movable particles; of such
sizes and figures, and with such other properties as most
conduced to the end for which He formed them. And
that these primitive particles, being solids, are incomparably
harder than any of the sensible porous bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
compounded of them; even so hard as never to wear, or
break in pieces; no other power being able to divide
what God made one in the first Creation. While these
corpuscles remain entire, they may compose bodies of one
and the same matter and texture in all ages; but should
they wear away or break in pieces, the nature of things
depending on them would be changed. Water and earth
composed of old worn particles and fragments of particles,
would not be of the same nature and texture now
with water and earth composed of entire particles at the
beginning. And therefore, that Nature may be lasting,
the changes of corporeal things are to be placed only in
the various separations and new associations of these
permanent corpuscles.”</p>

<p>So wrote the man, “Qui genus humanum ingenio
superavit,” who at the age of twenty-four had already invented
the Fluxional Calculus, discovered the Decomposition
of Light, and enunciated and proved, in a series
of lemmas, the law of Universal Gravitation.</p>

<p class="tb">But soft! What is this which steals upon our senses
through bobbing apple-blossoms at the open casement?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
It is the delicious, oystery smell of the Sea, as the afternoon
tide runs in with a sound like that of fairy-bells
upon the sand and rock and loose shingle.</p>

<p>That scent, and sight, and sound, are altogether irresistible.
We throw aside Dr. Buckland and Hugh Miller,
clap on a “wide-awake,” rush down at once by the zig-zag
path, and madly catch up a bunch of dripping tangle,
and kick a hole in the moist sand, and presently find that
our “Balmorals” are ancle-deep in the brine of a nimble
wave.</p>

<p>And now I descry a faint purplish hue upon the red
beach which lies at the foot of Culver. To-morrow, we
will breakfast early, and hunt up a score of pebbles
before the day grows hot.</p>

</div>

<p>The elemental powers which are constantly at work in
Nature all around us are upon a vast scale; a scale, in
fact, which is immeasurable by us, except when observed
under certain favourable circumstances. As our practical
ideas of locomotion are immensely surpassed by
the speed of the Earth’s rotation on her axis, which
is at the equator rather more than 1000 miles an hour,
and yet far more surpassed by the rate at which she
moves in her orbit round the Sun, which exceeds 20,000
miles an hour, so also our experience of a puff of
wind on the hillside, or a dash of water in our face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
when a slanting shower or the spray from a cataract
salutes us, gives us no conception of the stupendous
powers which are exerted when the sea, convulsed by a
storm, rages along some unprotected coast.</p>

<p>Once in my life, I remember being knocked down by
a blast of wind; and several times, as I suppose has
happened to many persons, I have been <em>floored</em> by an
unexpected billow while bathing. I always made this
reflection at the moment: “Its power is not known: it
has floored <em>me</em> easily enough, but perhaps it would have
felled an ox.”</p>

<p>But a wave impelled by the gale, which could take an
ox off his legs, is nothing at all. What is the measure
of force actually applied when a stout ship is shivered on
a lee shore? No one knows. When the Clarendon,
West-Indiaman, struck on that fatal “race” off Blackgang
Chine, she went utterly to pieces <em>within seven
minutes</em>! Yet, what a delicate thing is AIR! What a
yielding thing is WATER! But then the air and
water threw her <em>on a lee shore</em>.</p>

<p>Observations, carefully made at the right time and
place, enlighten our ignorance upon all these matters.
Air, delicate as it seems, when compressed, explodes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
roar of the thunder; and water is almost <em>in</em>compressible,
and therefore its blow will knock down <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>Let us speak first of the power of the WIND. The
sands of the Desert, as has been said, are powdered quartz
and quartz is a heavy substance; but when a strong wind
ploughs the surface of the Desert at an angle, these Sands
are lifted, and made to gyrate in spiral folds, and a huge
column is formed—perhaps a hundred and fifty feet in
height—and this monstrous trunk is presently carried
along at whirlwind speed; and if it meet a party of
travellers, they will be overwhelmed and buried.</p>

<p>It may be said that the sand is in very minute
particles; and this is true. But if they are, therefore,
the more easy to disturb and to catch up aloft, they are
all the more difficult to bind together in a spiral form,
and to hurry along the desert unbroken.</p>

<p>The power of the wind, especially when it comes in
sudden gusts, and with a whirling motion, against timber-trees
and the upper parts of buildings, is only too well
known; on wide, exposed plains, its fury, in the early
part of the year, sometimes brings destruction to everything
within its range. But it is on the open sea, where
the hurricane, once let loose from heaven, can sweep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
unchecked, perhaps for hundreds of miles, that the latent
forces of this unseen element are revealed in all their
terror and majesty. For here the wind not only has free
scope, but it also finds another element, fluid but incompressible,
to obey its impulse and follow in the course
which it takes. If the WIND be like a wild spirit, the
WATER is a mighty, irresistible body, endowed with
motion by the other, and capable of any work, from the
drowning of a sea-gull to the wrecking of a stately ship.</p>

<p>The waves which roll in from the open sea, when the
tide is <em>making</em>, are the most powerful. Fortunately,
these do not reach the shore with quite the same force
which they exert at the distance of some miles from it;
but in exposed situations, their altitude and momentum
are very great. The billows of the Atlantic which
break on the western coast of Ireland run from thirty
feet to fifty feet in height, and they arrive on that coast
with an impetus which has (up to a certain point)
been gaining strength, perhaps for half the time of a
tide. It was this fearful onset, from a foe that never
slumbered, which broke up and rendered useless the
eastern extremity of the great Submarine Electric Telegraph
Cable between Ireland and America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>It has now been decided that when stormy winds prevail
long in one direction, another and peculiar force is
given to the waves on which they operate. For the wind,
by pressing long <em>on the side</em> of a wave, changes its form
from that of an upright ridge (<i>i.e.</i> with <em>vertical</em> axis) to
one which has a stoop or bend, sometimes of great
inclination. Such a wave will come in upon the shore
with far greater momentum, for its <em>velocity</em> has been
enormously increased, while its <em>bulk</em> is nowise diminished.
The speed which the water acquires under the
influence of a prolonged sou’-wester on the coasts of
Sussex and Hampshire, although there the gale has only
traversed the breadth of the Channel, is very notable at
times. At Lowestoft and at Peterhead, easterly points of
land, the danger of the winds from the North Sea is proportionally
far greater, as a larger body of water has
been continuously acted upon. For it must always be
remembered that a wave at sea is simply an <em>oscillation</em>
of the water which rises and falls in that place.
The identical wave does not pass on to the shore, though
it appears to do so; it is the <em>motion</em> which is propagated,
and, as it were, handed on, like an electric shock
through the successive plates of a battery. Now this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
motion <em>increases</em> with the onward career of the gale.
“Vires acquirit eundo.” And when the mass of the
fluid over which the wind is blowing has once been
agitated, and the equilibrium of its upper layers been
thoroughly disturbed, if the current of air not only continue,
but wax stronger and stronger, there scarcely
seems any limit to the momentum which the rolling
wave may thus acquire. The arithmetic of a few facts
upon this subject will, however, give us some idea of
what that momentum must be on certain occasions.</p>

<p>It has been found, by experiment, that the velocity
imparted to an incoming wave sometimes equals <em>seventy
feet in a second of time</em>. Now this would give nearly
one mile in a minute, if it were a projectile in free space;
but the case here is, of course, different, since the wave
is only a portion of the mass to which it belongs, and no
individual wave travels very far. Still, the amount of
rush and pressure which are exerted is altogether stupendous.
Probably the <em>breakers</em>, which in an enduring
storm rise against a lighthouse in the open sea, are
among the strongest instances with which we are acquainted,
and, next to these, I suppose, the billows off
the Cape of Good Hope. But we may take those on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Irish coast, westward, as a well-known sample. I have
often watched these—once in a gale of wind—and I
have seen, in one as yet <em>unbroken</em> wave, a body of water
which I should compute roughly at two hundred tons’
weight, and as having, at the moment, a velocity of not
less than sixty feet in the second, discharge itself upon
the reef of rock. On such occasions, if you happen to
stand on the shore, you will feel the ground <em>vibrate</em> apparently,
though the sensation is probably electrical.
But let any one consider the conditions of the wave cited
above, and reckon what is <em>the force of the blow</em> at the
moment of impact. I have no doubt it would knock
down a good strong house, if delivered against the upright
face of it.</p>

<p>One winter, when I was at Sandown, in the Isle of
Wight, a spot frequently mentioned in these pages, I
found I was <em>utterly unable</em> to traverse the bit of open
road reaching from the Fort to the point where the lane
turns off to Yaverland. Yet I had on at the time a stout
Cording’s waterproof, with sleeves, and a slouched hat
tied under my chin, and held a powerful oaken stick in
my hand to help me win my way. In fact, it was a trial
of dynamics between me and the gale, whether this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
“body,” acted on by a continuous muscular force, in
nearly a right line, could be propelled through that
resisting medium. I am sorry to say, it could <em>not</em>; but,
in the attempt, it lost a neck-button from its coat, and
was within an ace of being blown into the hedge, like a
certain “man in Thessaly, wondrous wise,” whom we
have heard tell of in our childhood.</p>

<p>This storm held on for seven or eight hours, and as
the sea rose many feet higher than usual under its influence,
when the tide was well in, the strife of elements,
and their combined assault upon the works of men’s
hands were truly grand. A breach was made through
the solid causeway, compact long ago of clay, and gravel,
and boulders of flint, and guarded seaward by dykes of
timber. This breach was effected, I have no doubt, by
the <em>stroke</em> of the wave, as the sword of Roland is said
to have cut through the rock in the fight of Roncesvalles.
A wall of stout masonry, not above five feet in height,
and supported behind by earthworks, so as to resemble
an escarpment, yielded before the weight of water, as a
pane of plate-glass would give way at the charge of a
locomotive engine. Some twenty yards’ length of it was
rent and thrown down. On examining this fragment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
afterwards, I found that the materials of the wall were
solid blocks and angular bits of Wenlock limestone, and
the cement used of the strongest. I believe, however,
if it had been three times as strong a barrier, those waves
would have levelled it.</p>

<p>I subsequently witnessed in that very neighbourhood a
yet more furious tempest of wind, but had no opportunity
of measuring its effects.</p>

<p>At Eastbourne, about two years age, I made acquaintance
with a phenomenon in this line which was altogether
new to my experience. We had a tremendous gale late
in the autumn of 1857. I cannot exactly cite the quarter
from which the wind blew, as I do not accurately know
the points of the compass in their bearing on the town
and bay; but the storm seemed to beat in from the
south-east, as it faced the Marine Esplanade. I went
forth, with perhaps a score of others, to gaze upon this
magnificent “encountering shock” of earth, air, and
water. We were all of us drenched to the skin by the
dashing spray, and occasionally well-nigh swept off our
legs by the gust; but we held on stoutly, <em>till</em> something
saluted those nearest the beach, which rendered a retreat
imperative. This was not the salt spray, nor the rattling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hail neither, but a cloud of “skirmishers” in the shape of
<em>pebbles and gravel</em> from the strand below. The sea had
actually lifted the surface of the bed of beach, and
whirled aloft some bushels of its solid contents. A coast-guard
told me next day, that he saw a “flight” of pebbles,
some of them as big as hens’ eggs, at least thirty
feet high in the air; and he added, that if the direction
of the wind had changed a little, every pane of glass on
the ground and first-floor of the Esplanade must have
been shivered to atoms. As it was, of course much
damage was done to windows and sashes; but not by the
actual pebbles.</p>

<p>After this gale had subsided, I ascertained by personal
inspection that some hundred tons’ weight of solid shingle
had been moved along the shore a distance of a quarter
of a mile, in the space of a few hours. This was by the
sidelong <em>drag</em> of the tide.</p>

<p>The village of Seaford, on this same line of coast, had
long been in great danger of being swept away by the
tide. Its outworks and very standing ground were perceptibly
yielding, season after season.</p>

<p>About eight years ago, the inhabitants took the alarm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and drew up a remonstrance and petition, which were
duly forwarded to the authorities. Proper officers were
deputed to go down from London and report; and the
result of their representations was that an able engineer
from head-quarters was empowered “videre ne quid
Respublica detrimenti capiat;” or, in the modern vernacular,
to see that the Queen’s lieges in Seaford suffered
no wrong.</p>

<p>The remedy hit upon was simple and forcible; but,
assuredly, it was an instance of what is called “Hobson’s
choice.” The engineer said, “There is only one thing to
be done; a solid breakwater must be formed west of the
town, to break the rush of the sea and divert the course
of the current. We will throw down a section of the
chalk-cliff; that will make a mound, on which works of
masonry, if necessary, can be erected afterwards.”</p>

<p>This was done about two miles east of Newhaven, by
firing an enormous charge of gunpowder in chambers
drilled in the limestone. I went over from Brighton to
witness it, and the sight was a striking one, as soon as
the smoke and dust consequent on the explosion had
cleared away. The operation, neatly conducted with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
electric battery, proved successful; and its result, in the
amount of chalk thrown down on the beach, was judged
sufficient for the time.</p>

<p>But for this “pièce de resistance,” Seaford might by
this be in a fair way to furnish to future generations a
gigantic specimen of a marine fossil.</p>

<p>The danger to Seaford arose not from storms or any
casual visitations, but from the steady continuous action
of the tide encroaching on the line of coast where the
town stands. Whether the chalky breakwater above described
will long suffice to counteract this elemental mischief
may be doubted. If after a while it should prove
inadequate, the operation will have to be repeated on a
larger scale.</p>

<p>The height of the tides at sea is always known; and
it varies little, depending upon astronomical causes, chiefly
on the attraction exercised by the moon. But on shore,
and inland in certain rivers, the case is widely different.
Here the land itself, with its rocks and embankments, introduces
artificial conditions which influence the local
tides in an extraordinary manner. Thus, at Chepstow,
by the Castle rock, the rise of a spring-tide is sometimes
as much as <em>sixty feet perpendicular</em>. In Mount’s Bay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Cornwall, it is fully <em>forty feet</em>; while in the north of
Scotland on the coast, it does not average more than <em>ten</em>.</p>

<p>The tides have other variations beside this of local
magnitude; and one of these, which takes place along
our southern coast, is interesting and important, but was
little known till the Admiralty surveyors went to work.
It may be briefly described as follows.</p>

<p>As far as Scilly Isles and the Lizard’s Point, the great
tidal wave, which twice in every twenty-four hours flows in
from the Atlantic, maintains pretty nearly the same level on
the opposite shores; and this continues as far as Exmouth
on the Devon coast, and St. Malo on that of Brittany.
But when this great wave reaches the “Needles” which
form the westerly point of the Isle of Wight, it divides
into two very unequal portions. Of these, the southern
and larger portion sweeps round the base of the island,
passing Freshwater and Chale and Blackgang, and then
rounding St. Catherine’s promontory and running up to
Dunnose with scarcely-diminished velocity; but the
northern and smaller half enters the Solent, and owing, it
is supposed, to the resistance of two shores (by <em>friction</em>)
to its progress, advances but slowly, and does not arrive
at Southampton Water before the other has made Dunnose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and is filling Sandown Bay with a <em>back</em>-stream.
This causes many differences in the amount of water at
almost any given moment on the two sides of the Isle of
Wight, north and south; and it gives rise to many
curious varieties of tides, real or apparent. In one spot
near Shanklin, my attention was frequently drawn to the
fact of a partial tide suddenly <em>flowing</em>, for perhaps the
space of an hour, during the time of ebb.</p>

<p>But this is not the only “water-company” here at
work, nor is the above the only class of phenomena resulting
from such agency. Beside the <em>tide-wave</em> there
is the Ocean-<em>current</em>, which is quite a distinct thing.
This current is due to a branch of the Gulf-stream;
and it flows here from west to east, and from south to
north. That is to say, after leaving Newfoundland, so
much of it as actually reaches Britain would run up
St. George’s channel northwards, and up the English
channel eastwards. And although the velocity of this
current is but trifling, yet, owing to its unceasing action
in one direction, its effects are remarkable. Moreover, it
is not affected by the waves; whether the sea be sleeping
in a calm or tossed with storms, the motion of the current
is the same. The only change as yet observed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
when its waters come to the surface and have their temperature
lowered by a chill wind; for, this gulf-stream is
itself a river of <em>warm water</em>, though its bottom and
banks are of the same element <em>cold</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, between tide-waves and currents, changes are
going on continually both in the volume and the physical
constitution of the sea-water. And this, which might at
first on a hasty glance look like casual and unimportant
variation, when we come to consider it attentively, is
found to be an arrangement fraught with wisdom and
beneficence; for it insures continual variations of temperature,
it attracts the purifying storms, restores the elastic
spring of the atmosphere, and provides for weary man a
healthy tonic breeze when he rambles along the beach or
scales the face of the cliff. Without the motion imparted
by the tides, the sea would probably become putrid. Now
the tides depend upon the MOON; yet how seldom
do we think of her invaluable services, when we gaze
upon her pale face! An Italian once told me that he
“loved the moon, adored the moon, never tired of looking
at the moon.” And the Padishah,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I have heard say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
prefers “moon-faced” ladies for his soft companions; but
I doubt whether either the pensive Italian or the glittering
lord of the Bosphorus ever bestowed five minutes’ thought
on the mighty phenomenon of the TIDES.</p>

<p>There are other changes in what may be termed the
tidal “high-water mark,” due to the lapse of ages, which
the sea has chronicled on the face of many a shore and
cliff. It is well known that the coast-line, in this and
other countries, has experienced many alterations as to its
level. In some places, the ocean has apparently encroached
upon the land; in many others, it has receded.
One striking <em>index</em> of this latter, and which may be implicitly
trusted as proving the fact, occurs where the
waters have retired from their former level, and have left
exposed to view the remains of an ancient <em>beach</em>. Thus,
between Brighton and Ovedean, is found what goes by
the name of the “Elephant-bed,” because such fossil
bones lie among the pebbles in this part of the cliff. The
entire stratum undoubtedly was at one time a beach.
Similar phenomena have been traced along the coast-lines
of Arbroath and Cromarty shires.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the sea has gained upon the land; undermining
the friable sandstone cliffs, and, as it were, melting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
down the headlands, so as to change the outline of
the coast. But in these latter instances, although “terra
firma” has given way, it may be doubted whether the
water itself has <em>risen</em>. Wherever it has indubitably done
so, to the extent <i>e.g.</i> of submerging a village, I should
apprehend the presence of volcanic agency.</p>

<p>GEOLOGY LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF EARTHLY THINGS.</p>

</div>

<p>There seems to be no strong reason for doubting that
every elementary substance of which we have any knowledge
was <em>separated</em> at the first from that crude mass
called “the earth,” and which, along with “the heaven,”
God created in the beginning.</p>

<p>For, after that first assertion, we read of continued acts
of “separation” by an Almighty <i lang="la">fiat</i>. Thus light is
separated from darkness; waters from waters; water from
earth. And by a like analogy we may suppose that the
“firmament” or atmosphere, the lower part of which we
breathe, was also eliminated in its component gases from
the primitive shapeless bulk of matter.</p>

<p>If we take forty-five miles as the average height of this
atmosphere above the surface of our globe, it is proportionately,
like the thin rind upon an apple, or the bloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
upon a peach; and may very well have come forth without
any violence done to nature, or any waste of her resources,
from the womb of the earth.</p>

<p>OXYGEN is a gas universally diffused, for without a
large supply of it human beings and all the mammals,
birds, and reptiles, would die. But oxygen is not a
more <em>simple</em> element than CARBON or SILICON; and
silicon is almost as universal, for it enters largely into
the composition of all known rocks, excepting coal,
limestone, and rock-salt.</p>

<p>Then, beside silicon and carbon, there is BORON,
and many others, all of which will combine permanently
with the principal gases, and which we may, therefore,
fairly suppose did so in the beginning.</p>

<p>The oxygen which we breathe enters into composition
with almost all known substances. It constitutes about
one-fifth of the atmosphere, perhaps eight-ninths of the
water, and helps chemically to compound all forms of
earth and rock, and all the metals save five. Now this
proclaims at once a <em>kindred</em> element, and does not look
like a substance made independent of all the others at
the first. Even <em>potash</em> and <em>soda</em>, which were long called
“fixed alkalis,” having resisted all attempts to decompose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
them, yielded at last to a galvanic process, and were
found to be compound; oxygen, in both cases, having
united itself intimately with a metallic base.</p>

<p>It is probable, therefore, that every substance which
we can handle, or of which we can recognize the presence
by a chemical test, was as truly a part of the chaotic
Earth as was the clay or the granite. The gaseous atmosphere
or “firmament” was eliminated by an act of
creation from the torpid mass, the waters were drawn off
and gathered together, the rocks consolidated, the metals
precipitated, most of the crystals were probably perfected
by galvanic operations. But there is nothing, from the
crystallized blocks of the mountains to the salt held in
solution in the sea, from the heavy rain-cloud which
darkens the sky to the gossamer films of vapour which
fringe the outermost edge of our atmosphere, which was
not actually present as an existing particle when the
Earth, “<em>Mother</em>-Earth,” was made. And the EARTH,
as we see, could very well furnish all these concomitant
and subsidiary elements, without being impoverished at
all. Indeed, as far as experiments and investigations
proper have gone, we have as yet only touched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<em>surface</em> of our globe. The deepest mine which men
have ever sunk into the bowels of the earth bears in its
depth the same proportion to the earth’s radius, as a
<em>line</em>, or one-eighth of an inch, bears to the height of the
monument at London Bridge. Some of the exposed
strata of rock, allowing for the <em>tilting-up</em> of their
edges, certainly reveal a deeper sample than this; but
still, it is like the prick of a pin on the hide of a
rhinoceros; it does not even penetrate the creature’s
folded hide; but of what lies <em>within</em> it tells us nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Baily’s successful attempt at “weighing the
Earth,” which, with consummate patience and skill, he
brought to a termination in his house in Tavistock Square,
has established the physical fact that this planet is not “a
hollow sphere,” as some persons had supposed, but <em>solid</em>,
probably to its very centre, and of considerable specific
gravity. Here is a mighty mass of Matter; it may be,
as Dr. Whewell has argued, the <em>greatest mass</em> (in solid
contents) in our Solar system. What do we know of its
interior construction, economy, and arrangement? Nothing,
except that all obey the <em>laws</em> established by the
Creator, whether those of gravitation, cohesive attraction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
or chemical combination. The “statistical report” is
wanting, especially in such departments as those of the
Trap and Volcanic lavas.</p>

<p>The amount of SALT in the ocean is a circumstance
which geologists have not, I think, sufficiently considered.
This salt, if precipitated, would, it is believed, yield a
solid range of mountains equal to that of the entire
Himalaya. Now, mighty rivers run into the sea, as
those of La Plata, Amazons, Mississippi, St. Lawrence,
Orinoko, and many others; but <em>none of these rivers are
salt</em>; they are enormous bodies of fresh water. How,
then, does the ocean maintain everywhere its saline
character unimpaired? not to ask, whence did so much
salt come? There is, indeed, a hill of salt in Spain,
and there are mines of rock-salt in Poland and Hungary;
but the <em>effort</em> which was made, so to speak,
when the proportion now existing in the ocean was
squeezed out of the huge terrestrial sponge, must far
have exceeded that of any subsequent addition or
contribution.</p>

<p>The ocean itself, as <em>girding</em> this globe, is a prodigious
mass of water, indeed. But, if we remember the size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the globe itself, as given by its diameter, Ocean appears
like a rain-pond. For, if we call its average depth five
miles—and it cannot be more than this, may be much
less—such a watery envelope would be represented in its
proportion to the solid sphere which it surrounds, by a
coating of varnish of the thickness of this paper lying
on a globe which is twenty feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The COAL-MEASURES are also a remarkable
item in the list of substances met with in beds and
ranges, and claiming to be considered as rocks—for
the coal is a <em>petrifaction</em>, perhaps a partial <em>crystallization</em>—but
due to the deposition of vegetable matter,
subjected afterwards to enormous hydrostatic pressure.
We have no true estimate of their amount as yet, for
fresh mines are being continually discovered; but here
seems to consist the chief proportion of CARBON, as
developed in this part of the visible creation.</p>

<p>CHALK constitutes one-eighth part of the crust of
this globe. The mass of this must have been thrown up
<em>at once</em>, when the atmosphere was eliminated, and the
waters separated, and the sphere became condensed and
solid. It is a “carbonate of lime” in its chemical description,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and there is abundance of the limestone-rock
all over the world; but it is very difficult to extract from
this, in any quantity, the soft, friable, slightly unctuous
mineral which goes by the name of chalk (Latin,
“calx”).</p>

<p>The METALS exist in the rocks, generally some distance
down in the earth’s interior. Their amount, in
some instances, is very great indeed. The only one
which is rarely met with on our globe, and then in small
grains, is the NATIVE IRON, <i>i.e.</i> iron in its <em>pure</em>
state. This want, however, could not have been recognized
if we had not happened to find the substance in
question in those blocks of meteoric iron, and in the
small meteoric stones which have, from time to time,
fallen to the surface of the earth during atmospheric
storms, and, probably, owing to astronomical disturbances.
For, of the iron, in its mixed conditions of different
ores, we have an abundant supply. It is a
singular fact, that the <em>native gold</em>, both in pure grains
or flakes, and in solid “nuggets,” appears now to be the
more prevalent form of that ponderous and imperishable
substance. The ranges of quartz-rock in many chains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of mountains are certainly thickly sown with seeds and
nodules of fine gold.</p>

<p>I may mention here, as an interesting circumstance to
mineralogists and collectors of fossil pebbles, that the
“native iron,” which is so scarce on the surface of the
ground, is met with, from time to time, along with <em>manganese</em>,
in the heart of siliceous pebbles. But I have
never seen it where there is not the presence of some
animal organism.</p>

<p>Now all these <em>solids</em>, gold, iron, chalk, coal, salt—and
I select incongruous items on purpose—are as truly portions
of the earth’s mass as are the granite and slate,
the sandstones and clays. And <em>so are also</em> the flowing
waters and the suspended clouds; and <em>so are also</em> the
component elements of these—oxygen, hydrogen, and
the rest. It is, all of it, MATTER; it all obeys the
law of gravitation, and it needs just as much to be taken
into account, in a geological scheme or system, as the
upheaving of granite rocks, the flux of lavas, or the
icthyolite beds amidst the semi-crystalline ranges of the
Old Red Sandstone formation.</p>

<p>Consequently I have found, as has partly I trust been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
shown in the preceding pages, that even to handle and
pronounce upon a pebble, such an one as we can pick up
on the sea-shore any summer’s day, <em>all these elements</em>
must be taken into the account.</p>

<p>In a “moss-agate,” for instance, I discover—</p>

<p><i>First.</i> A sandy cuticle, which we will rub off, as it is
like the dust on your drawing-room table, a real thing,
but out of place.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> Siliceous matter.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> A purer form of this in chalcedony.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> The “moss,” which is a metal proper,
tinged by <em>oxidation</em>. [N.B. Here is oxygen inside a
pebble!]</p>

<p><i>Fifthly.</i> The whole or a part of some extinct animal’s
petrified structure.</p>

<p><i>Sixthly.</i> One thing more, <em>sometimes</em> a drop of water.</p>

<p><i>Seventhly and lastly.</i> Air, permeating the stone in
fine pores and channels, one of the largest of which was
in some cases a breathing-hole used by the zoophyte
before he drew his last gasp.</p>

<p>Who shall therefore say that a PEBBLE from the sea-shore
has nothing remarkable in it or about it, merely
because the passing schoolboy can pick it up if he pleases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and, without looking at it for a moment, can fling it at the
head of a gull, or dash it to atoms against a larger
stone? It is a microcosm in itself; and if it lead us on
to further inquiry and patient thought, it will amply repay
our trouble, though we <em>have</em> loitered away a summer
morn or an autumn evening among the Pebbles of the
Beach.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>GUESSES AT THE PROBABLE FEATURES OF A PAST SCENE.—WHAT
WAS THE EARTH’S <em>COMMENCING</em> ROTATION.—LAW
OF THE TIDES AT SUCH A TIME, AND CORRESPONDING
ACTION OF THE SEA UPON THE LAND.—ORIGINAL
CHARACTER OF THESE FOSSIL FORMS.</p>

</div>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the apparent scope or
tendency of some of the geological theories which are
rife in the present day, no person who has really considered
the subject in its principal bearings has any
doubt that the surface of our globe, both as to the
land and the water, was once very different from what
it is now. All sound argument must allow this to be
possible: all careful investigation pronounces it to be
the fact.</p>

<p>There are potent “menstrua” and mighty furnaces in
the laboratory of Nature; and while the actual <em>amount</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of MATTER in existence has, we suppose, never varied
since the original creative act which gave birth to “the
heaven and the earth,” the conditions, sensible or chemical,
under which that matter presents itself have
altered from century to century and from moment to
moment.</p>

<p>It is impossible to deem otherwise, if we believe that
the “laws” which are established now in this creation
were established then.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, the law of Universal Gravitation,
that law by which the heavenly bodies move in
their orbits, and a seconds’ pendulum measures <em>time</em> at
the surface of our Earth.</p>

<p>We feel assured that this law has never varied; but it
is almost equally certain that it must have <em>begun</em> to operate
<em>under different conditions</em> from those which obtain
at this day.</p>

<p>Newton, who always maintained that the commencing
axillary movement of the Earth was due to an impulse
from the hand of the Creator when He launched it into
space,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and who declared that without this he could in no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
way account for its having rotatory motion at all, was
nevertheless willing to allow that the time occupied in
the first rotation may not have been, as now, twenty-four
hours, but possibly an entire year. And as the Earth, once
projected, would fulfil, according to the Law of Gravity,
the conditions of “a body falling through space,” we find
that taking the nth term (2<i>n</i>-1) of the arithmetical
series … 1. 3. 5. 7. … (2<i>n</i>-1) … where the successive
terms represent the <em>velocities</em> acquired in successive
annual periods, about 183 such terms must elapse
before 365 rotations would be accomplished within the
space of one year, or, in other words, the rotation of the
earth be <em>diurnal</em>, as at present. This point of speed
once reached, the centrifugal and centripetal forces
balanced one another, and the axillary movement
became steady.</p>

<p>Of course, in the above hypothesis, the assuming of
one year for the first period is arbitrary; it may have
been more, it may have been less; but within certain
limits there is no absolute reason for supposing that it
was a span of twenty-four hours, as now. <em>Revelation</em>
nowhere asserts such a dogma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Supposing</em>, then, amid confessed ignorance as to how
the fact stood, that the Earth’s early times of rotation
were far longer than now, and taking, say, <em>one year</em> as
the first period, how would this influence other features
in a scene which has now long gone by? How would it
influence the Tides of the Ocean?</p>

<p>Assuming a correspondingly slow motion of the Moon
in her orbit, we should, it seems, have in the lapse
of the first year <em>one</em> rotation of the Earth and <em>two
Tides</em> of the Ocean; in the second year, <em>three</em> rotations
of the Earth and <em>six Tides</em> answering to them; and
so on.</p>

<p>Now these flowing Tides would, in fact, have been vast
<em>inundations</em>, the sea rising steadily for many months
together; and in like manner the prolonged ebb which
followed upon each flood would have given rise to a
<em>subsidence</em> and to the deposition of such particles of
mud, lime, silex, &amp;c., as the waters then held in solution
after their visiting the higher land.</p>

<p>And thus we see at once, without going further, that
the agency exerted by the ocean in ancient times may
probably have been different from and greater than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
with which we are now actually acquainted, save in the
account given to us, in the inspired Record, of the Deluge
in the days of Noah.</p>

<p>When such mighty agencies were in operation, it is
not unreasonable to suppose that great changes took
place in the way of partial extinction of animal life,
and the substitution of new forms to fill up the apparent
gap left by the perishing creatures. The contents of
the upper chalk, of the greensand, gault, and sandstones,
as has already been observed, point to such revolutions
and cycles in the history of animated nature.</p>

<p>MAN, who is himself an evident exception to all
this, may perhaps, <em>as</em> an exception, be said to prove that
such had been the rule. For, it must be remembered,
<em>all</em> the creatures were pre-Adamitic. Not only those
vast saurians and mammals, whose fossil remains we
have exhumed, and cannot contemplate without wonder,
were prior to our race in their actual possession of the
domain of the earth’s surface, but every bird, reptile,
fish, and zoophyte were certainly made before the man.
Now, as the man came last in order, but first in dignity,
created in his Maker’s image, and endowed with dominion
over all the works of His hand, there was no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
place or argument for extinction, substitution, or change,
among the creatures. <em>Death</em> was excluded, and could
not enter into the world, unless by a moral delinquency
of the chiefest creature.</p>

<p>But already it is probable, although he perhaps knew it
not, Man stood, even in the day of his innocence and
happiness, in the midst indeed of a blooming creation,
but upon the crust of a fossil world.</p>

<p>Moreover, we know from Scripture that minerals
find metals abounded; so that the presence of these
near the Earth’s surface ought not to be referred (as by
some they have been) to the epoch of Noah’s Deluge.
“Gold and bdellium and the onyx-stone” were already
in the “land of Havilah;” and Tubal-Cain was “an
artificer in brass and iron,” which must therefore have
been exposed in veins of the upper rocks.</p>

<p>And if the Earth already showed her nuggets of gold
and lumps of onyx, it is not likely that she was deficient
in beautiful fossils. Certainly, such substances as manganese
and native iron did not find their way into
the heart of siliceous pebbles in <em>modern</em> times.</p>

<p class="tb">But it by no means follows from the above, that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
these fossil forms belonged to creatures whose species
are wholly extinct. Indeed, in some instances, this cannot
be allowed for a moment. Probably, the “choanite”
is extinct. I doubt whether the “ventriculite” be so.
Dr. Mantell was pleased to assume that this last-mentioned
zoophyte <em>grew</em>—like one of the “mushroom”
class of plants—rooted to one spot. There is no evidence
for this whatever, and my impression leans another
way. In the class of marine “Acrita” termed <i>Acalephæ</i>,
there is a family which bears the name of <i>Rhizostoma</i>.
These animals are composed mainly of a large, mushroom-shaped,
gelatinous disc, and of a supporting
central pedicle. In structure and function this latter
organ much resembles the root of a plant; and, no
doubt, it absorbs nourishment by seizing upon the
minute animalculæ which abound in the water where the
“rhizostome” is floating about. The entire animal is
very like a toadstool, or “agaricus,” in form; but for all
that, he does not grow, as a plant, in one spot, but is
always sailing about by means of his large disc above-mentioned.
His general appearance closely resembles
that of a “ventriculite” from the flint; and I think it a
probable guess to assign them to the same species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The “branching alcyonite,” on the other hand, did, I
imagine, grow, like a Coral or “Encrinite,” in one place;
and I suppose it was much like an ice-plant in form, but
that it had the power of drawing back at will all its
branches and suckers—which were, in fact, the creature’s
arms and tentacles—into the root or bulb which formed
its base. The “sponges,” a large family, we know are
not extinct; and the conformation of the living individuals
fully bears out all the marvels which have been
predicated of the fossil animal. I have handled these
creatures, fresh from the sea, at Brighton; and I had an
unpleasant consciousness, while holding one in my hand,
that the round, greenish, jelly-like bush was only his
<em>house</em>; but that the gummy fluid, which held possession
of it after squirting out the sea-water, was the individual
himself, though independent of the accessories of bone
and muscle. This kind of “sponge” floats about: there
is another, well-known among submerged rocks, which
is fixed, and grows. I believe the fossil specimens to
have belonged to the migratory class.</p>

<p>I once picked up, near Hove, a pebble which contained
a fragment of the lungs of a tortoise; the
elevated ridges, and depressed pulmonary cells, appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to have left their peculiar structure in the flint. I have
mislaid this specimen, and so cannot give a sketch of
it here.</p>

<p>The “holothurida,” or “sea-cucumber,” is found occasionally
in the Isle of Wight, beautifully fossilized. A
specimen was shown to me, from the beach near Chale;
it was a <em>variety</em>, but unquestionably of this class of
animals.</p>

<p>A fossil, figured in one of the “chromo-plates” to
this volume, has obtained the name of a “troglodyte;”
I do not know why. I suspect it was one of the “asteridæ”
when alive, but that in the death-struggle, the
long arms collapsed and twisted together.</p>

<p>I have frequently found what I believe to have been
some such organ as the stomach of a star-fish in the
centre of hard pebbles. The form was always pentagonal,
like the corolla of certain flowers pressed flat.</p>

<p>The “myriapod,” depicted in Plate V., I should at
once conclude to have been a marine insect, answering
to some of our “scolopendridæ,” if the <em>head</em> were not
lacking. But since the back or spine in this fossil is
all in one piece, and there are no lateral plates or divisions
for the several pairs of feelers, it may be, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
accordance with such a frame, that the head fitted on
without the apparent juncture of a neck; and if so,
this may be an entire insect. It is right however to
add, that I feel some doubts about this.</p>

<p>The Plate VI. contains a figure of a fossil to which I
have attached the name of “Spindle-choanite.” In fact,
the specimen, until cut in twain, was fusiform; and, I
have no doubt, a complete animal.</p>

<p>The choanite from Eastbourne, <em>uncut</em>, Pl. IV., portrays
a creature who, I think, expired in a vehement struggle.
This would keep him on the surface of the siliceous
flood; and it would harden, for the most part, beneath
him, leaving his limbs sprawled out on the top of the
pebble, as now seen. The beautiful “pyriform” specimen,
Pl. VI., shows a similar struggle, amidst liquid
agate and manganese. In the large Actinia, or “star-choanite,”
portrayed in the frontispiece, the happy animal
died quite quietly; and that is why his fossil mummy is
of such a noble size and development.</p>

<p>The figure called “Nondescript,” Pl. IV., I do not
think represents any complete animal, but a part of the
organization of one. I have traced its likeness, in the
“Animal Kingdom,” by T. Rymer Jones; and think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
not improvable that a woodcut at p. 364 of that most
interesting volume depicts, in the <em>arms</em> of one of the
“Brachiopoda,” in that “calcareous loop” with its
curved “crura,” the exact structure which, in the living
animal, served to open or shut the bivalve shell, but in
the fossil specimen looks like a miniature-painting on
ivory, to perpetuate some curious organism in the liveliest
colours of the pallet. “Terebratula Chilensis” is
Mr. Rymer Jones’s animal; and in the very vicinity
where I found my fossil in question, I have since
obtained, in a flint pebble from the cliff, a beautifully
petrified “Pecten” (same species of shell) in agate.</p>

<p class="tb">I might multiply remarks and instances such as these;
but it is not needed. Every one will form their own
opinion, in collecting fossil pebbles, as to what the
<em>originals</em> were; but I think they will generally agree
with me, that while our living individuals differ in many
points, still we have mostly types of the same species
actually existing in our present seas.</p>

<p>What all connoisseurs, and even amateurs, should
do, is to preserve every remarkable specimen they may
obtain, along with an accurate note of where they got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
it. It is a great pity that, among so many persons who
have at once discernment and a liking for this branch of
Mineralogy, there are so few who will be at the trouble
of what lawyers call “taking minutes” of the evidence
which comes before them in the course of the pursuit.
I have looked over several fair enough collections made
by amateurs; but, with one exception, I never knew an
instance in which the collector could tell me, with any
degree of certainty, from what particular beach he had
gathered this or that specimen. Of course, when a
scientific investigation is proposed, such omission renders
the most valuable part of the collection comparatively
useless. For the locality is all-important. A
pebble may thus be always traced to its geological
“home” or birthplace. It can only have had one of
three sources: either it was first dropped <em>here</em>, where
you find it; or, it is a “travelled” pebble, having come
round from some distant beach; or, it is an offering
from the deep sea. The latter case is of exceedingly
rare occurrence, and need hardly be taken into account;
nevertheless, for truth’s sake, and to include all possible
varieties, I cite it here.</p>

<p>A genuine deep-sea pebble is a waif which I have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
twice, as yet, met with in my sea-side experience. One
of these was, I think, fished up in a dredging-net; the
other was thrown on the beach during a storm. In both
instances, the fossil was a “choanite,” and bore the
marks of having been washed out of a limestone rock.
The age of such fossil could not have been less than
4000 years, the date of Noah’s deluge, for obvious
reasons; but it may have been considerably greater.</p>

<p>If there were any known method of softening these
pebbles to a consistency like that of melted glue, we
might learn something concerning their past history;
but I am not aware of the existence of any such
process at present. <em>Silex</em>, once hardened into the condition
in which we meet with it, is a most intractable
substance to deal with; and the very fact of its having
at one time been viscous, renders it highly improbable
that, in the course of nature, its texture will ever assume
a plastic character again. Moreover, while the majority
of our flints are concretions, there are some which are
semi-crystalline. These latter, it is evident, cannot now
advance to the stage of perfect crystals; but neither can
they retrograde: the next change which awaits so hard a
substance must be, to crumble away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, on our beaches, hollow globes of flint are
picked up, which, when you break them open, are found
to be full of a white, powdery substance, like the
chemist’s magnesia. This is much the same as the
“rock-milk” of mineralogists, a very fine deposition of
lime, occasionally met with in beds of the chalk
strata, and considered to be a result of some filtering
process, when the water, after being long pent
up, had escaped by small crevices. But in the flint-globes
no such straining can have taken place; and in
sundry specimens which I have examined, I generally
came to the conclusion that some conchiferous animal
had been inclosed in the nodule, and his shell had
afterwards broken and been pulverized. Sometimes I
found within the “rock-milk” a dark-brown, carbonaceous
spot; this would be the creature’s body, as
Dr. Mantell supposes of his “molluskite.” The cavity
is never quite filled up. I imagine many of these
“powder-horns” to be altogether modern in their
date.</p>

<p>A much more curious phenomenon than the above
occurs from time to time in solid agate-pebbles, which,
when picked up, are found to contain in a central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
chamber, visible to the eye, a drop of water. These
are scarce, and fetch a high price at the museums. As
much as twenty pounds has been more than once given
for an undoubted specimen. How the above-mentioned
singular effect was arrived at, has, I believe, never been
explained; at least, not so as to satisfy a close reasoner.
The same <i lang="la">lusus naturæ</i> is met with, I think more frequently,
in rock-crystal and in the dark fluor-spars.</p>

<p>The last apparent animal organism which I shall
notice, as having more than once occurred to me as a
<em>possible</em> explanation of the patterns disclosed in certain
sections of agate-pebbles, is that of some creature’s
“ovary.” The eggs of the whelk, and those of the
cuttle-fish, are deposited in clusters, like some of the
“grapes” on sea-weed. I have found, in some of the
Isle of Wight pebbles, a conformation closely resembling
this, but on a much smaller scale. That the
original substance was part of an animal, I have no
doubt whatever; and the arrangement of the lobes or
spherules, composing the mass, more resembles that of
the spawn of the above-named fishes than anything else
which I am acquainted with. Still, resemblance is not
identity. The thing may be only a curious coincidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
resulting from some unexplained freak of nature; as
when she carved the profile of Napoleon’s face in the
outline of a part of Mont Blanc, and also (quite as distinctly)
in that of a hill which overlooks the town of
Belfast.</p>

<h2>REFERENCES TO THE CHROMO-PLATES.</h2>

<p>In the <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a> is represented the polished section of a pebble
which the author picked up on the beach at Bonchurch, in the
Isle of Wight. This is an unusually large and perfect specimen,
the body of the Choanite lying nearly central. The pebble
contains one or two blotches of <em>native iron</em>. The “cuticle” is
uninjured.</p>

<h3><a href="#plate1">PLATE I.</a></h3>

<p>Fig. 1. This is a slice from a lump of “conglomerate” found
on the beach at Sidmouth. The <em>white</em> parts are sections of the
nodules of quartz, the <em>red</em> and <em>yellow</em> are jasper.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. A section of an “Alcyonite” from the bay of Sandown.
It formed part of a large pebble.</p>

<h3><a href="#plate2">PLATE II.</a></h3>

<p>Fig. 1. This is, I have no doubt, a fossil “Actinia.” I have
often looked on the exact living resemblance of it at the fish-house
in the “Zoological Gardens,” where it is fond of clinging
like a limpet against the vertical pane of glass in an aquarium.—(<i>Found
in Sandown Bay.</i>)</p>

<p>Fig. 2. I suppose this half of a pebble to represent the internal
structure of some creature which dwelt in a bivalve shell.—(<i>Sandown
Bay.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<h3><a href="#plate3">PLATE III.</a></h3>

<p>Fig. 1. This sponge, a faultless specimen of the kind, is from
the Brighton beach. It was the first pebble I ever picked up
there.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. The body and arms of this Choanite are in white Agate;
the remainder of the stone is a dark moss, formed chiefly of
<em>Manganese</em>, and surrounded by a yellow flinty rim.—(<i>Brighton
Beach.</i>)</p>

<h3><a href="#plate4">PLATE IV.</a></h3>

<p>Fig. 1. A Nondescript: but, probably, the creature was of the
vermicular kind.—(<i>Brighton Beach.</i>)</p>

<p>Fig. 2. A handsome Choanite, uncut, but polished over, so as
to show the points of some of the feelers.—(<i>Found at Eastbourne.</i>)</p>

<h3><a href="#plate5">PLATE V.</a></h3>

<p>Fig. 1. An “Eyed” Jasper, from the beach near Shoreham. It
contains yellow “oxide of iron,” and some dark green flint.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. A “Myriapod.” This fossil is a very handsome one,
and I have another, closely resembling it, from the same locality,
in Sandown Bay. The dark, reddish spot, is of the nature of
<em>Molluskite</em>.</p>

<h3><a href="#plate6">PLATE VI.</a></h3>

<p>Fig. 1. A Spindle, or <em>Fusiform</em> Choanite, when the pebble was
entire. I do not possess a more perfect specimen: the Chalcedony
is remarkably fine, and the “oxide” of a rich tint.—(<i>Sandown
Bay.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 2. Pyriform Choanite, uncut. Here, again, the creature
lies over the surface; and, as I conceive, from the position which
it occupies, was swimming for its life.—(<i>Found at Rottingdean.</i>)</p>

<h3><a href="#plate7">PLATE VII.</a></h3>

<p>Fig. 1. An “Asterid.” This is different from all the other
creatures in these fossils. Its position in the heart of a solid
limestone pebble is singular.—(<i>Beach at Hove.</i>)</p>

<p>Fig. 2.—“Terebratula.” The entire pebble was formed inside
of a “Pecten”-shell, and <em>inside the pebble</em> lies this formation,
which was a living organism connected with the hinge.—(<i>Beach
near Luccombe.</i>)</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
